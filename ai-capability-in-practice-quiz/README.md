## How the scoring rubric is intended to be used

The scoring rubric is:
- **optional**
- **formative**
- **diagnostic**

It supports:
- reflection
- group discussion
- identification of strengths and development priorities  

It should **not** be used to:
- certify competence
- rank individuals
- enforce thresholds

Balanced capability across domains matters more than high scores in any single area.

## Alignment with the AI Capability Framework

These resources align explicitly with the six domains of the **CloudPedagogy AI Capability Framework**:

1. Awareness & Orientation  
2. Human–AI Co-Agency  
3. Applied Practice & Innovation  
4. Ethics, Equity & Impact  
5. Decision-Making & Governance  
6. Reflection, Learning & Renewal  

The quiz and rubric are designed to reveal **patterns and imbalances** across domains, rather than isolated strengths.
