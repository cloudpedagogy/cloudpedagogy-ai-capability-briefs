# Facilitation & Briefing Slide Templates

This folder contains **adaptable slide-based facilitation and briefing resources**
designed to support structured conversations using the **CloudPedagogy AI Capability Framework**.

These materials are intended for use in:
- institutional workshops
- governance and leadership briefings
- curriculum and assessment design sessions
- research practice discussions
- professional development contexts

They are **not instructional slide decks** and are **not designed to be presented verbatim**.
Instead, they provide structured prompts and framing to support judgement,
discussion, and decision-making where AI use carries responsibility.
