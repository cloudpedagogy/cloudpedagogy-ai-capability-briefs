## 1. What this brief is for

This brief is for cultural policy teams, arts councils, funding bodies, and grant-making organisations responsible for shaping priorities, allocating resources, and safeguarding public value in creative and cultural sectors where artificial intelligence increasingly influences production, distribution, and evaluation.

It is intended for bodies involved in:

- cultural policy development and oversight  
- funding, commissioning, and grant allocation  
- evaluation of cultural programmes and impact  
- stewardship of public or charitable funds  
- setting norms and standards for cultural practice  

This is not a technology adoption guide or a creative innovation strategy.  
It is a capability briefing to support principled judgement, equity, and defensible decision-making when AI intersects with cultural policy and funding decisions.

## 2. Why AI capability matters for cultural policy and funding

Cultural policy and funding decisions shape ecosystems rather than individual outputs. AI is increasingly used to:

- analyse applications and funding portfolios  
- support evaluation and impact assessment  
- inform policy development and strategic priorities  
- monitor sector trends and participation  

Decisions in this space:

- influence who gets funded and who does not  
- shape cultural narratives and representation  
- affect livelihoods and institutional survival  
- carry public accountability and scrutiny  

Without explicit AI capability, funding bodies risk:

- embedding bias into funding decisions  
- privileging scale, familiarity, or data-rich applicants  
- eroding trust in fairness and transparency  
- drifting from cultural and public value objectives  

AI capability ensures that AI supports cultural stewardship rather than distorting it.

---

## 3. Common risks and blind spots in AI-supported cultural governance

Across cultural policy and funding contexts, recurring challenges appear:

- **Representation bias:** AI favouring established or data-visible organisations  
- **Impact distortion:** quantitative signals outweighing qualitative value  
- **Opacity:** limited explainability in AI-assisted assessment  
- **Standardisation pressure:** narrowing of cultural diversity  
- **Equity erosion:** marginalised voices disadvantaged by data-driven processes  
- **Policy drift:** AI shaping priorities implicitly rather than explicitly  

These risks undermine legitimacy if not actively managed.

## 4. Applying the six domains of AI capability in cultural policy and funding

The AI Capability Framework provides a principled structure for responsible use of AI in cultural governance.

### 4.1 AI Awareness & Orientation

Policy and funding bodies need a shared understanding of how AI processes applications, evidence, and trends.

This includes:

- recognising pattern-matching and optimisation tendencies  
- understanding limits in capturing cultural nuance and value  
- avoiding assumptions that data-driven equals fair  

This domain supports informed oversight rather than technocratic drift.

---

### 4.2 Human–AI Co-Agency

Cultural judgement must remain human-led.

AI capability here involves:

- ensuring final decisions rest with accountable panels or officers  
- treating AI as a support for review, not a replacement for judgement  
- maintaining clear accountability for funding outcomes  

Clear co-agency underpins legitimacy and trust.

---

### 4.3 Applied Practice & Innovation

AI can support responsible innovation in cultural governance.

This domain supports:

- managing volume and complexity of applications  
- exploring portfolio-level patterns and gaps  
- supporting evidence-informed policy development  

Innovation must serve cultural purpose, not efficiency alone.

---

### 4.4 Ethics, Equity & Impact

Cultural funding has distributive and symbolic power.

AI capability in this domain includes:

- examining how AI affects inclusion and representation  
- protecting minority, experimental, or community-based practice  
- ensuring public value is not reduced to measurable outputs  

Ethical stewardship is central to cultural policy.

---

### 4.5 Decision-Making & Governance

Funding and policy decisions are subject to scrutiny.

AI capability here involves:

- documenting how AI informed assessment or prioritisation  
- aligning AI use with public law, policy goals, and values  
- supporting transparency and defensibility in decision-making  

Good governance protects both institutions and cultural ecosystems.

---

### 4.6 Reflection, Learning & Renewal

Cultural sectors evolve continuously.

Capability is strengthened when funding bodies:

- review patterns and outcomes of AI-assisted decisions  
- learn from appeals, feedback, and sector response  
- adjust criteria and practices over time  

This domain supports adaptive, values-led cultural governance.

---

## 5. Practical actions for cultural policy and funding bodies

The following actions strengthen AI capability in cultural governance:

- **Make values explicit**  
  Clarify what AI should and should not optimise for.

- **Treat AI outputs as advisory**  
  Preserve deliberation and expert judgement.

- **Protect diversity intentionally**  
  Look beyond dominant patterns and signals.

- **Ensure transparency**  
  Be able to explain AI-informed processes to applicants.

- **Document reasoning**  
  Record how decisions were reached.

- **Review impacts regularly**  
  Monitor who benefits and who is excluded.

---

## 6. Signals of mature AI capability in cultural policy and funding

Funding systems with strong AI capability typically demonstrate:

- transparent and defensible funding decisions  
- equity-aware allocation of resources  
- protection of cultural diversity and experimentation  
- confidence under public and sector scrutiny  
- alignment between policy intent and outcomes  
- reflective, learning-oriented governance  

These signals reflect cultural stewardship maturity, not technological adoption.

## 7. How this brief fits within the AI Capability Framework

This brief applies the AI Capability Framework (2026 Edition) to cultural policy and funding contexts.

To deepen this work, bodies may explore:

- the full AI Capability Framework (PDF)  
- Practice Guides focused on governance and public impact  
- the Application Handbook for organisational implementation  
- facilitated policy and funding review workshops  

The Framework provides structure.  
Cultural policy and funding bodies provide stewardship, legitimacy, and public value.
