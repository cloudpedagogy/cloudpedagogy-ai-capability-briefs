## 1. What this brief is for

This brief is for creative practitioners and arts organisations working across visual arts, performance, writing, music, design, film, and interdisciplinary practice in contexts where artificial intelligence increasingly shapes creative processes, production, dissemination, and evaluation.

It is intended for:

- independent artists and creative practitioners
- arts organisations and cultural producers
- creative directors and programme leads
- arts educators and facilitators
- organisations stewarding the creative commons

This is not a guide to generative art tools or prompt techniques.  
It is a capability briefing to support authorship, integrity, and cultural value when AI becomes part of creative practice.

## 2. Why AI capability matters in creative practice

AI is increasingly used in creative contexts to:

- generate or transform text, images, sound, and video
- support ideation, variation, and experimentation
- assist editing, translation, and accessibility
- analyse audiences and engagement

These capabilities open new creative possibilities, but also raise deep questions:

- what constitutes authorship and originality
- how labour and credit are recognised
- whose cultural material is being drawn upon
- how creative value is assessed and defended

AI capability enables creative practitioners to engage with AI critically and intentionally, rather than reactively or defensively.

---

## 3. Common risks and blind spots in creative AI use

Across creative sectors, recurring challenges appear:

- **Authorship ambiguity:** unclear boundaries between human creation and system output.
- **Value dilution:** creative labour reduced to prompt optimisation.
- **Cultural extraction:** AI trained on creative works without consent or context.
- **Homogenisation:** stylistic flattening driven by pattern-based generation.
- **Opacity:** audiences unaware of AI’s role in creative work.
- **Ethical fatigue:** pressure to adopt AI without time for reflection.

These risks arise when AI enters creative practice without shared capability or language.

---

## 4. Applying the six domains of AI capability in creative contexts

The AI Capability Framework provides a principled way to engage AI without collapsing creative meaning.

### 4.1 AI Awareness & Orientation

Creative practitioners need realistic understanding of how AI generates creative outputs.

This includes:

- recognising that AI recombines patterns rather than expressing intent
- understanding limitations in originality and contextual meaning
- avoiding assumptions that novelty equals creativity

This domain supports creative discernment, not technical mastery.

---

### 4.2 Human–AI Co-Agency

Creative authorship must remain human-led.

AI capability here involves:

- articulating where creative decisions reside
- deciding when AI is a tool, collaborator, or constraint
- resisting narratives that displace creative agency

Clear co-agency protects artistic identity and accountability.

---

### 4.3 Applied Practice & Innovation

AI can support creative exploration when used deliberately.

This domain supports:

- using AI for ideation, variation, and provocation
- integrating AI outputs into reflective creative processes
- experimenting without surrendering authorship

Innovation is valuable when AI expands possibility rather than replaces intention.

---

### 4.4 Ethics, Equity & Impact

Creative work shapes culture and representation.

AI capability in this domain includes:

- considering whose work and cultures are being drawn upon
- recognising power dynamics in training data and platforms
- addressing issues of consent, credit, and appropriation

Ethical creative AI use requires cultural responsibility, not just compliance.

---

### 4.5 Decision-Making & Governance

Creative organisations operate within funding, commissioning, and public accountability structures.

AI capability here involves:

- making defensible decisions about AI use in funded work
- being transparent with commissioners, partners, and audiences
- aligning AI use with organisational values and commitments

Good governance protects trust and sustainability.

---

### 4.6 Reflection, Learning & Renewal

Creative practice evolves continuously.

Capability is strengthened when practitioners:

- reflect on how AI shapes creative thinking and process
- adapt practice deliberately rather than following trends
- participate in collective learning and dialogue

This domain supports long-term creative resilience.

---

## 5. Practical actions for creative practitioners and organisations

The following actions strengthen AI capability in creative contexts:

- **Clarify authorship**  
  Be explicit about creative decision-making and responsibility.

- **Use AI as provocation, not replacement**  
  Treat outputs as prompts for human creativity.

- **Attend to provenance**  
  Consider where data, styles, and influences come from.

- **Communicate transparently**  
  Decide how and when to disclose AI involvement.

- **Align with values**  
  Ensure AI use reflects artistic and organisational principles.

- **Reflect collectively**  
  Create space for dialogue about AI and creative futures.

---

## 6. Signals of mature AI capability in creative practice

Creative environments with strong AI capability typically demonstrate:

- clear articulation of authorship and intent
- thoughtful integration of AI into creative workflows
- ethical awareness of cultural impact
- confidence in explaining creative decisions
- resilience to technological hype cycles
- sustained creative experimentation with integrity

These signals reflect artistic maturity, not technological novelty.

## 7. How this brief fits within the AI Capability Framework

This brief applies the AI Capability Framework (2026 Edition) to creative and cultural practice.

To deepen this work, practitioners and organisations may explore:

- the full AI Capability Framework (PDF)
- Practice Guides related to public-impact and creative contexts
- the Application Handbook for values-led implementation
- facilitated conversations on AI, culture, and authorship

The Framework provides structure.  
Creative practitioners provide meaning, authorship, and cultural value.
