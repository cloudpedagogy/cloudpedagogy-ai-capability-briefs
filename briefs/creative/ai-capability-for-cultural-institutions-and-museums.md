## 1. What this brief is for

This brief is for cultural institutions and museums responsible for collecting, interpreting, preserving, and presenting cultural heritage in contexts where artificial intelligence increasingly shapes curation, interpretation, access, and public engagement.

It is intended for:

- museum and gallery professionals
- curators and collections managers
- learning, engagement, and interpretation teams
- digital heritage and archives staff
- leaders responsible for public trust and cultural stewardship

This is not a guide to generative art tools or digital exhibitions.  
It is a capability briefing to support cultural integrity, ethical stewardship, and public trust when AI becomes part of cultural practice.

## 2. Why AI capability matters for cultural institutions

AI is increasingly used in cultural contexts to:

- catalogue, tag, and analyse collections
- generate interpretive text or educational content
- support translation, accessibility, and discovery
- personalise visitor experiences
- analyse audience engagement and behaviour

While these uses can increase access and efficiency, cultural institutions carry distinctive responsibilities:

- stewardship of contested histories and identities
- representation of diverse voices and perspectives
- protection of cultural and intellectual rights
- maintenance of public trust and authenticity

AI capability ensures that AI supports cultural meaning and inclusion, rather than flattening interpretation or reproducing bias.

---

## 3. Common risks and blind spots for cultural institutions

Across museums and cultural organisations, recurring challenges appear:

- **Interpretive flattening:** AI-generated narratives oversimplifying complex histories.
- **Bias reproduction:** historical bias embedded in training data shaping interpretation.
- **Authorship ambiguity:** unclear provenance of AI-generated text or descriptions.
- **Cultural misrepresentation:** loss of context, voice, or community authority.
- **Ethical drift:** efficiency gains overshadowing cultural responsibility.
- **Public trust risk:** visitors unaware of AI’s role in interpretation.

These risks arise when AI is introduced without explicit cultural judgement.

---

## 4. Applying the six domains of AI capability in cultural institutions

The AI Capability Framework provides a values-based structure for responsible cultural AI use.

### 4.1 AI Awareness & Orientation

Cultural professionals need realistic understanding of how AI shapes interpretation.

This includes:

- recognising that AI generates patterns, not cultural meaning
- understanding how training data reflects historical power structures
- avoiding assumptions that AI outputs are culturally neutral

This domain supports critical cultural literacy, not technical deployment.

---

### 4.2 Human–AI Co-Agency

Cultural interpretation must remain human-led.

AI capability here involves:

- ensuring curatorial judgement retains authority
- clarifying where AI supports access versus interpretation
- resisting delegation of meaning-making to systems

Clear co-agency protects curatorial integrity.

---

### 4.3 Applied Practice & Innovation

AI can support innovation in cultural engagement when used thoughtfully.

This domain supports:

- enhancing accessibility through translation and alternative formats
- supporting exploratory discovery without replacing interpretation
- augmenting, not automating, curatorial work

Innovation is valuable when AI is framed as a tool for access, not authorship.

---

### 4.4 Ethics, Equity & Impact

Cultural institutions have ethical obligations to communities and histories.

AI capability in this domain includes:

- recognising whose voices are amplified or marginalised
- engaging communities in decisions about representation
- considering intellectual property and cultural rights

Ethical practice requires intentional, community-aware design.

---

### 4.5 Decision-Making & Governance

Cultural organisations operate under public scrutiny.

AI capability here involves:

- documenting how AI is used in interpretation or engagement
- aligning AI use with institutional values and ethical codes
- ensuring explainability and transparency for audiences

Good governance sustains credibility and trust.

---

### 4.6 Reflection, Learning & Renewal

Cultural meaning evolves over time.

Capability is strengthened when institutions:

- review how AI-mediated interpretation is received
- learn from community feedback and critique
- adapt practices deliberately rather than invisibly

This domain supports living, responsive cultural stewardship.

---

## 5. Practical actions for cultural institutions and museums

The following actions strengthen AI capability in cultural contexts:

- **Clarify AI’s role in interpretation**  
  Distinguish between access support and meaning-making.

- **Protect curatorial authority**  
  Ensure humans remain accountable for narratives presented.

- **Engage communities**  
  Involve stakeholders in decisions about representation.

- **Surface bias deliberately**  
  Examine how data and history shape AI outputs.

- **Be transparent with audiences**  
  Communicate where AI supports content or engagement.

- **Reflect and adapt**  
  Treat AI use as subject to continuous ethical review.

---

## 6. Signals of mature AI capability in cultural institutions

Cultural institutions with strong AI capability typically demonstrate:

- clear human ownership of interpretation
- ethical, community-aware use of technology
- transparency about AI involvement
- sensitivity to historical and cultural context
- confidence in public dialogue and critique
- adaptive learning over time

These signals reflect cultural stewardship maturity, not digital sophistication.

---

## 7. How this brief fits within the AI Capability Framework

This brief applies the AI Capability Framework (2026 Edition) to cultural institutions and museums.

To deepen this work, institutions may explore:

- the full AI Capability Framework (PDF)
- Practice Guides related to public engagement and high-impact contexts
- the Application Handbook for governance and ethics pathways
- facilitated workshops on AI and cultural stewardship

The Framework provides structure.  
Cultural institutions provide meaning, memory, and public trust.
