## 1. What this brief is for

This brief is for members of Boards, Governing Councils, Trustees, and equivalent senior oversight bodies responsible for setting strategic direction, safeguarding public trust, and ensuring effective governance in contexts where artificial intelligence increasingly shapes organisational decisions and operations.

It is intended for governing bodies that:

- hold ultimate accountability for organisational performance  
- oversee risk, ethics, and compliance  
- approve strategy, investment, and major initiatives  
- assure institutional reputation and public confidence  

This is not a technical briefing on AI systems or a management handbook.  
It is a capability briefing to support informed oversight, sound judgement, and defensible governance when AI becomes part of organisational strategy and decision-making.

## 2. Why AI capability matters for boards and governing councils

Boards operate at the highest level of accountability. As AI becomes embedded across organisations, boards are increasingly expected to:

- oversee AI-enabled strategies and investments  
- assure that AI use aligns with organisational values and purpose  
- manage reputational, ethical, and systemic risk  
- respond to external scrutiny from regulators, funders, and the public  

Without explicit AI capability, boards risk either:

- over-delegating critical judgement to executives or technical teams, or  
- blocking innovation through uncertainty and risk aversion  

AI capability enables boards to ask the *right questions* and set *appropriate constraints* without needing technical expertise.

---

## 3. Common risks and blind spots at board level

Across sectors, recurring governance challenges appear:

- **Delegation drift:** AI oversight assumed to sit entirely with management  
- **Strategic opacity:** AI initiatives framed as operational rather than strategic  
- **Risk fragmentation:** ethical, legal, and reputational risks treated separately  
- **Assurance gaps:** limited visibility into how AI shapes real decisions  
- **Overconfidence:** reliance on expert assurance without challenge  
- **Late engagement:** boards involved only after problems emerge  

These risks arise when AI is treated as a technical issue rather than a governance concern.

---

## 4. Applying the six domains of AI capability at board level

The AI Capability Framework provides boards with a structured lens for exercising effective oversight without micromanagement.

### 4.1 AI Awareness & Orientation

Board members need a shared, realistic understanding of how AI affects organisational decision-making.

This includes:

- recognising where AI influences judgement, not just efficiency  
- understanding uncertainty, bias, and limitations at a conceptual level  
- avoiding reliance on simplified narratives of AI capability  

This domain supports informed questioning, not technical competence.

---

### 4.2 Human–AI Co-Agency

Ultimate accountability must remain clearly human-owned.

AI capability here involves:

- ensuring responsibility for AI-influenced decisions is explicitly assigned  
- rejecting narratives that attribute outcomes to systems rather than people  
- reinforcing executive accountability to the board  

Clear co-agency underpins legitimate governance.

---

### 4.3 Applied Practice & Innovation

Boards must enable innovation without compromising trust.

This domain supports:

- setting principles for responsible AI adoption  
- approving experimentation within defined risk tolerances  
- distinguishing strategic innovation from unmanaged exposure  

Innovation becomes sustainable when bounded by governance.

---

### 4.4 Ethics, Equity & Impact

Boards are custodians of organisational values and public interest.

AI capability in this domain includes:

- considering how AI affects fairness, inclusion, and public trust  
- anticipating societal and reputational impacts  
- ensuring ethical considerations are embedded, not retrospective  

Ethical oversight requires foresight rather than crisis response.

---

### 4.5 Decision-Making & Governance

Boards must be able to defend decisions under scrutiny.

AI capability here involves:

- requiring transparency about where AI influences decisions  
- ensuring appropriate reporting and assurance mechanisms  
- integrating AI considerations into existing governance structures  

Good governance is coherent, not additive.

---

### 4.6 Reflection, Learning & Renewal

AI-related risks and opportunities evolve rapidly.

Capability is strengthened when boards:

- review AI governance arrangements periodically  
- learn from incidents, near-misses, and external developments  
- update oversight approaches as organisational maturity grows  

This domain supports adaptive, future-ready governance.

---

## 5. Practical actions for boards and governing councils

The following actions strengthen AI capability at board level:

- **Surface AI explicitly**  
  Ask where AI influences judgement or decision-making.

- **Clarify accountability**  
  Ensure named owners for AI-related risks and decisions.

- **Integrate oversight**  
  Embed AI into existing risk, ethics, and assurance processes.

- **Request proportional assurance**  
  Seek evidence of capability, not technical detail.

- **Document governance rationale**  
  Record how AI considerations informed board decisions.

- **Review regularly**  
  Treat AI governance as an ongoing responsibility.

---

## 6. Signals of mature AI capability at board level

Boards with strong AI capability typically demonstrate:

- confident, informed challenge of AI-related proposals  
- clear accountability and escalation pathways  
- alignment between strategy, values, and AI use  
- resilience under regulatory or public scrutiny  
- proportionate support for innovation  
- continuous learning at governance level  

These signals reflect governance maturity, not technological sophistication.

## 7. How this brief fits within the AI Capability Framework

This brief applies the AI Capability Framework (2026 Edition) to board-level and governing council oversight.

To deepen this work, boards may explore:

- the full AI Capability Framework (PDF)  
- Practice Guides focused on governance and leadership  
- the Application Handbook for structured oversight pathways  
- facilitated board-level capability discussions  

The Framework provides structure.  
Boards provide stewardship, accountability, and public trust.
