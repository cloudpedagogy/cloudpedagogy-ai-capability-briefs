## 1. What this brief is for

This brief is for members of Ethics Review Boards, Ethics Committees, and equivalent advisory or decision-making bodies responsible for reviewing non-research activities where artificial intelligence may affect people, communities, or public trust.

It is intended for ethics bodies that review or advise on:

- operational or administrative AI use  
- student- or staff-facing AI systems  
- AI-supported decision processes  
- policy, procurement, or service design involving AI  

This is not a technical ethics manual or a legal compliance guide.  
It is a capability briefing to support ethical judgement, consistency, and defensible decision-making when AI is introduced into non-research organisational contexts.

## 2. Why AI capability matters for non-research ethics review

Many AI-enabled activities fall outside formal research governance but still raise ethical questions, including:

- automated decision support affecting individuals  
- AI use in education, assessment, or student services  
- predictive or profiling systems in organisational operations  
- AI-mediated communication with the public  

Ethics boards are increasingly asked to evaluate such activities without:

- established ethical review pathways  
- standardised evidence or documentation  
- clear precedent  

Without explicit AI capability, ethics review risks becoming inconsistent, overly cautious, or disconnected from real practice.

AI capability enables ethics boards to provide proportionate, principled oversight beyond traditional research ethics models.

## 3. Common risks and blind spots in non-research AI ethics review

Across institutions, recurring challenges appear:

- **Scope ambiguity:** uncertainty about what requires ethical review  
- **Framework mismatch:** applying research ethics models to operational contexts  
- **Evidence gaps:** limited documentation of AI decision pathways  
- **Ethics dilution:** treating ethics as a one-off approval step  
- **Inconsistent thresholds:** uneven scrutiny across cases  
- **Late involvement:** ethical issues surfaced after deployment  

These risks weaken ethical assurance and public trust.

## 4. Applying the six domains of AI capability in ethics review

The AI Capability Framework provides a coherent structure for non-research ethics review in AI contexts.

### 4.1 AI Awareness & Orientation

Ethics board members need a shared understanding of how AI operates in practice.

This includes:

- recognising probabilistic and adaptive behaviour  
- understanding limitations of explainability  
- avoiding assumptions that AI systems are neutral or objective  

This domain supports informed ethical questioning, not technical evaluation.

---

### 4.2 Human–AI Co-Agency

Ethical responsibility must remain human-led.

AI capability here involves:

- ensuring humans remain accountable for outcomes  
- rejecting narratives that displace responsibility onto systems  
- clarifying who owns ethical risk and mitigation  

Clear co-agency is essential for credible ethical oversight.

---

### 4.3 Applied Practice & Innovation

Ethics boards must adapt their review practices.

This domain supports:

- developing proportionate, context-sensitive review approaches  
- recognising legitimate innovation while identifying risk  
- avoiding unnecessary barriers to responsible practice  

Innovation in ethics review strengthens relevance and trust.

---

### 4.4 Ethics, Equity & Impact

This domain sits at the heart of ethics review.

AI capability here includes:

- anticipating differential impacts on individuals and groups  
- recognising bias and structural inequity  
- considering long-term and cumulative effects  

Ethical review must move beyond intention to impact.

---

### 4.5 Decision-Making & Governance

Ethics boards operate within governance systems.

AI capability here involves:

- documenting ethical reasoning clearly  
- aligning advice with organisational values and policy  
- supporting defensible decisions under scrutiny  

Good governance embeds ethics into organisational decision-making.

---

### 4.6 Reflection, Learning & Renewal

Ethical norms evolve as AI use expands.

Capability is strengthened when ethics boards:

- review outcomes of approved AI uses  
- learn from incidents or concerns  
- update guidance and thresholds over time  

This domain supports living, responsive ethics governance.

---

## 5. Practical actions for ethics review boards (non-research)

The following actions strengthen AI capability in ethics oversight:

- **Clarify scope early**  
  Define which AI uses require ethical consideration.

- **Ask impact-focused questions**  
  Focus on who may be affected and how.

- **Require proportionate documentation**  
  Seek clarity without imposing excessive burden.

- **Surface equity considerations explicitly**  
  Do not assume neutrality or fairness.

- **Record ethical reasoning**  
  Document judgements, not just decisions.

- **Review post-implementation**  
  Treat ethics as ongoing, not one-off.

---

## 6. Signals of mature AI capability in non-research ethics review

Ethics governance with strong AI capability typically demonstrates:

- consistent and transparent ethical judgements  
- proportional, context-aware review processes  
- integration with organisational governance  
- confidence under public or regulatory scrutiny  
- learning-oriented ethical practice  
- sustained trust from stakeholders  

These signals reflect ethical maturity, not procedural complexity.

## 7. How this brief fits within the AI Capability Framework

This brief applies the AI Capability Framework (2026 Edition) to non-research ethics review contexts.

To deepen this work, ethics boards may explore:

- the full AI Capability Framework (PDF)  
- Practice Guides focused on ethics and high-impact contexts  
- the Application Handbook for governance integration  
- facilitated ethics scenario workshops  

The Framework provides structure.  
Ethics boards provide judgement, legitimacy, and moral assurance.
