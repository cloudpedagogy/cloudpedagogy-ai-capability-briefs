## 1. What this brief is for

This brief is for governance and oversight roles responsible for assurance, accountability, and institutional integrity in contexts where artificial intelligence increasingly shapes academic, research, operational, and public-facing decisions.

It is intended for:

- academic boards and committees  
- ethics and research governance bodies  
- quality assurance and accreditation groups  
- senior oversight and risk committees  
- policy and compliance leads  

This is not a technical guide and not a policy document.  
It is a capability briefing designed to support informed judgement, proportionate oversight, and defensible decision-making where AI is involved.

## 2. Why AI capability matters for governance and oversight

AI systems are now embedded across institutional activity, often indirectly:

- informing assessment design and feedback processes  
- shaping research workflows and analysis  
- supporting decision-making in admissions, progression, or resource allocation  
- influencing public communication and reporting  
- affecting staff and student experience in uneven ways  

For governance bodies, the challenge is not to manage AI tools, but to ensure that AI-influenced practices remain accountable, ethical, transparent, and aligned with institutional values.

Traditional governance mechanisms were not designed for probabilistic, adaptive systems.  
AI capability provides the lens needed to update oversight without over-regulation or loss of academic freedom.

## 3. Common governance risks and blind spots

Across institutions, several recurring risks emerge when AI use outpaces governance capability:

- **Opacity:** decisions influenced by AI without clear explanation or documentation  
- **Policy drift:** local practices diverging from institutional guidance  
- **False assurance:** reliance on technical controls or detection tools as substitutes for judgement  
- **Responsibility gaps:** unclear accountability when AI contributes to outcomes  
- **Equity risks:** uneven impacts on different groups not surfaced at governance level  
- **Over-centralisation or under-reach:** governance either too heavy-handed or too distant from practice  

These risks are rarely solved through new rules alone.  
They require capability-aware oversight.

## 4. Applying the six domains of AI capability to governance and oversight

The AI Capability Framework supports governance bodies in evolving their role from compliance monitoring to informed stewardship.

### 4.1 AI Awareness & Orientation

Oversight bodies need a shared understanding of how AI systems operate at a conceptual level.

This includes:

- recognising that AI outputs are probabilistic and context-dependent  
- understanding common failure modes such as bias, hallucination, and over-confidence  
- avoiding simplistic framings of AI as either neutral or inherently harmful  

This domain enables governance bodies to ask better questions, not technical ones.

---

### 4.2 Human–AI Co-Agency

Governance must ensure that accountability remains human-owned.

This involves:

- clarifying where human judgement must sit in AI-influenced processes  
- ensuring AI supports, rather than replaces, professional decision-making  
- avoiding ambiguity about responsibility when AI contributes to outcomes  

Clear co-agency is essential for trust, auditability, and public confidence.

---

### 4.3 Applied Practice & Innovation

Oversight should not suppress legitimate innovation.

AI capability supports:

- proportionate risk-based oversight rather than blanket restrictions  
- enabling safe experimentation within clear guardrails  
- learning from practice rather than governing in abstraction  

This domain helps governance bodies balance innovation with responsibility.

---

### 4.4 Ethics, Equity & Impact

AI often amplifies existing structural inequalities.

Governance capability in this domain includes:

- scrutinising differential impacts across groups  
- ensuring ethical considerations are embedded in routine decision-making  
- recognising cumulative effects of multiple AI-influenced processes  

Ethics here is not a checklist; it is an ongoing evaluative responsibility.

---

### 4.5 Decision-Making & Governance

This domain is central to oversight roles.

It involves:

- ensuring AI-related decisions are documented and explainable  
- aligning local practice with institutional policy and external expectations  
- maintaining clear audit trails where AI influences outcomes  

Effective governance focuses on traceable judgement, not micromanagement.

---

### 4.6 Reflection, Learning & Renewal

Governance capability must evolve alongside practice.

This includes:

- reviewing how AI use changes over time  
- updating oversight approaches as risks and benefits shift  
- supporting institutional learning rather than reactive rule-making  

This domain ensures governance remains adaptive, credible, and forward-looking.

## 5. Practical actions for governance and oversight bodies

The following actions strengthen AI capability without expanding bureaucracy unnecessarily:

- **Establish a shared AI capability lens**  
  Use a common framework to guide discussion and evaluation.

- **Focus on decision points**  
  Identify where AI meaningfully influences outcomes and concentrate oversight there.

- **Require transparency, not technical detail**  
  Ask for clarity on use, rationale, and accountability rather than system internals.

- **Embed equity considerations**  
  Ensure differential impacts are surfaced and addressed.

- **Document rationale**  
  Record how AI considerations informed governance decisions.

- **Review periodically**  
  Treat AI governance as iterative rather than static.

---

## 6. Signals of mature AI capability in governance

Institutions with strong AI governance capability typically demonstrate:

- clear ownership of AI-related decisions  
- consistent alignment between policy and practice  
- proportionate, risk-based oversight  
- confidence in responding to external scrutiny  
- transparent communication about AI use  
- a culture of reflective stewardship rather than defensive compliance  

These signals indicate governance maturity, not constraint.

## 7. How this brief fits within the AI Capability Framework

This brief applies the AI Capability Framework (2026 Edition) to governance and oversight functions.

To deepen this work, governance bodies may wish to explore:

- the full AI Capability Framework (PDF)  
- the Application Handbook for implementation pathways  
- Practice Guides focused on governance and decision-making  
- facilitated capability reviews or board-level workshops  

The Framework provides structure.  
Governance provides institutional judgement.
