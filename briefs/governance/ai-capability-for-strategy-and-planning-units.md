## 1. What this brief is for

This brief is for Strategy, Planning, Policy, and Corporate Development units responsible for shaping organisational direction, priorities, and investment decisions in contexts where artificial intelligence increasingly influences future capability, operating models, and risk profiles.

It is intended for teams that:

- lead strategic planning and horizon scanning  
- advise senior leadership and governing bodies  
- coordinate cross-organisational initiatives  
- translate vision into plans, frameworks, and roadmaps  

This is not a technology roadmap or an AI adoption guide.  
It is a capability briefing to support strategic judgement, coherence, and defensible decision-making when AI becomes part of long-term organisational planning.

## 2. Why AI capability matters for strategy and planning

AI introduces deep uncertainty into strategic decision-making. Its effects are:

- cross-cutting rather than contained  
- rapid but uneven across functions  
- difficult to reverse once embedded  
- closely tied to values, trust, and legitimacy  

Strategy and planning units are increasingly asked to:

- incorporate AI into future-facing strategies  
- advise on capability investment and sequencing  
- align innovation with governance and ethics  
- avoid both hype-driven adoption and paralysis  

Without explicit AI capability, strategy risks becoming either speculative or disconnected from operational reality.

AI capability enables strategy teams to integrate AI thoughtfully into organisational futures without over-committing or under-preparing.

---

## 3. Common risks and blind spots in AI-influenced strategy

Across organisations, recurring strategic challenges appear:

- **Tech-led framing:** strategy driven by tools rather than purpose  
- **Capability mismatch:** ambition exceeding organisational readiness  
- **Siloed foresight:** AI considered separately from workforce, culture, and governance  
- **Assumption lock-in:** early AI narratives hardening into strategy prematurely  
- **Risk underestimation:** ethical and reputational impacts treated as secondary  
- **Planning fragility:** strategies that cannot adapt as AI evolves  

These risks undermine strategic credibility and resilience.

---

## 4. Applying the six domains of AI capability in strategy and planning

The AI Capability Framework provides a stable lens for strategic decision-making under uncertainty.

### 4.1 AI Awareness & Orientation

Strategy teams need a shared understanding of AI’s strategic characteristics.

This includes:

- recognising uncertainty, variability, and limitation  
- understanding where AI affects judgement rather than efficiency  
- avoiding deterministic or hype-driven narratives  

This domain supports strategic realism, not prediction.

---

### 4.2 Human–AI Co-Agency

Strategic authority must remain human-led.

AI capability here involves:

- ensuring strategic decisions are not outsourced to forecasts or models  
- recognising AI as an input to judgement, not a driver of vision  
- maintaining accountability for strategic choices  

Clear co-agency protects strategic intent and legitimacy.

---

### 4.3 Applied Practice & Innovation

Strategy units must balance experimentation with coherence.

This domain supports:

- enabling bounded innovation and pilots  
- sequencing AI capability development deliberately  
- aligning experimentation with long-term goals  

Innovation becomes strategic when it is integrated, not fragmented.

---

### 4.4 Ethics, Equity & Impact

Strategy shapes organisational values in action.

AI capability in this domain includes:

- anticipating societal and workforce impacts  
- recognising equity implications of AI-enabled change  
- aligning AI strategy with public purpose and trust  

Ethical foresight is a strategic responsibility, not an afterthought.

---

### 4.5 Decision-Making & Governance

Strategic plans must be defensible under scrutiny.

AI capability here involves:

- embedding AI considerations into governance and assurance  
- ensuring strategic choices can be explained and justified  
- aligning planning with risk, ethics, and accountability structures  

Good governance strengthens strategic confidence.

---

### 4.6 Reflection, Learning & Renewal

Strategic environments evolve rapidly.

Capability is strengthened when strategy teams:

- review assumptions regularly  
- adapt plans based on learning and evidence  
- treat AI strategy as iterative rather than fixed  

This domain supports adaptive, future-ready planning.

---

## 5. Practical actions for strategy and planning units

The following actions strengthen AI capability in strategic roles:

- **Reframe AI as a capability issue**  
  Focus on people, governance, and systems — not tools alone.

- **Stress-test assumptions**  
  Explore multiple plausible futures involving AI.

- **Align ambition with readiness**  
  Sequence investment and change realistically.

- **Integrate ethics early**  
  Build values and trust into strategy design.

- **Document strategic rationale**  
  Record why AI-related choices were made.

- **Review and adapt**  
  Treat AI strategy as a living process.

---

## 6. Signals of mature AI capability in strategy and planning

Organisations with strong AI capability at strategic level typically demonstrate:

- coherent, values-aligned AI strategy  
- realistic assessment of capability and risk  
- integration across governance, workforce, and operations  
- resilience under external scrutiny  
- flexibility as technologies and norms evolve  
- confidence in long-term direction  

These signals reflect strategic maturity, not technological boldness.

## 7. How this brief fits within the AI Capability Framework

This brief applies the AI Capability Framework (2026 Edition) to strategy and planning contexts.

To deepen this work, strategy teams may explore:

- the full AI Capability Framework (PDF)  
- Practice Guides focused on leadership and governance  
- the Application Handbook for organisational implementation  
- facilitated foresight and scenario-planning workshops  

The Framework provides structure.  
Strategy and planning units provide direction, coherence, and renewal.
