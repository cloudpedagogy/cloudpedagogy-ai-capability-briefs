## 1. What this brief is for

This brief is for Data Protection, Information Governance, and Privacy roles responsible for safeguarding personal, sensitive, and confidential information in contexts where artificial intelligence increasingly shapes data processing, analysis, and decision-making.

It is intended for:

- data protection officers (DPOs)
- information governance and privacy leads
- records management and compliance teams
- digital risk and assurance roles
- staff advising on lawful and ethical data use

This is not a legal interpretation of data protection law or a technical security manual.  
It is a capability briefing to support informed judgement, proportionate oversight, and defensible governance when AI is part of data-driven work.

## 2. Why AI capability matters for data protection and information governance

AI systems change how data is:

- collected, combined, and inferred
- processed and reused beyond original purposes
- summarised, transformed, or repurposed
- stored, transmitted, and retained

For data protection and governance roles, this creates new challenges:

- traditional consent and purpose limitation assumptions are strained
- risk may emerge through inference rather than direct processing
- staff may use AI tools informally without understanding data exposure
- accountability becomes harder to demonstrate after the fact

AI capability enables governance teams to anticipate and shape risk, rather than responding only after incidents occur.

---

## 3. Common risks and blind spots for data protection and information governance

Across organisations, recurring risks include:

- **Invisible data disclosure:** sensitive data entered into external AI systems.
- **Inference risk:** new personal data inferred from non-sensitive inputs.
- **Purpose drift:** data reused in ways not originally anticipated.
- **Over-reliance on policy:** assuming rules alone prevent misuse.
- **Tool opacity:** limited understanding of how AI providers handle data.
- **Advisory overload:** governance teams becoming bottlenecks rather than enablers.

These risks reflect capability gaps in practice, not lack of compliance intent.

---

## 4. Applying the six domains of AI capability in data protection and governance

The AI Capability Framework provides a structured way to strengthen information governance without becoming tool-focused.

### 4.1 AI Awareness & Orientation

Governance roles need a clear understanding of how AI systems interact with data.

This includes:

- recognising that AI can generate new personal data through inference
- understanding limitations of anonymisation and aggregation
- avoiding assumptions that “no upload” equals no risk

This domain supports risk literacy, not technical implementation.

---

### 4.2 Human–AI Co-Agency

Accountability for data use must remain human-owned.

AI capability here involves:

- clarifying who is responsible for decisions about data use
- reinforcing that AI systems do not carry legal responsibility
- ensuring staff understand their role in safeguarding data

Clear co-agency strengthens accountability and compliance.

---

### 4.3 Applied Practice & Innovation

AI can support legitimate innovation when data risks are understood.

This domain supports:

- enabling safe exploration with appropriate safeguards
- distinguishing low-risk from high-risk AI use cases
- supporting proportionate controls rather than blanket bans

Innovation becomes sustainable when governance is context-sensitive.

---

### 4.4 Ethics, Equity & Impact

Data practices have real consequences for individuals.

AI capability in this domain includes:

- recognising differential impacts on vulnerable groups
- considering long-term consequences of data reuse or inference
- ensuring fairness and transparency in AI-informed processing

Ethical governance extends beyond minimum legal compliance.

---

### 4.5 Decision-Making & Governance

Data protection is a governance function.

AI capability here involves:

- integrating AI considerations into DPIAs and risk assessments
- documenting rationale for decisions involving AI use
- aligning advice with organisational risk appetite and values

Good governance ensures decisions are defensible and auditable.

---

### 4.6 Reflection, Learning & Renewal

Data risks evolve as AI systems and practices change.

Capability is strengthened when governance teams:

- review emerging patterns of AI-related data use
- update guidance and training iteratively
- learn from near-misses as well as incidents

This domain supports resilience rather than reactive enforcement.

---

## 5. Practical actions for data protection and information governance roles

The following actions strengthen AI capability in governance contexts:

- **Surface AI-related data use**  
  Encourage staff to make AI use visible and discussable.

- **Focus on inference risk**  
  Consider what new data AI might generate, not just what is input.

- **Update DPIA thinking**  
  Ensure assessments reflect AI-specific data dynamics.

- **Clarify advisory boundaries**  
  Support informed decision-making without becoming a blocker.

- **Align guidance with reality**  
  Ensure policies reflect actual workflows and tools in use.

- **Build shared understanding**  
  Promote data literacy alongside compliance.

---

## 6. Signals of mature AI capability in data protection and governance

Organisations with strong AI capability in this area typically demonstrate:

- proactive identification of AI-related data risks
- clear human accountability for data decisions
- proportionate, risk-based governance controls
- staff confidence in seeking advice early
- transparent documentation of decisions
- continuous learning rather than incident-driven change

These signals reflect governance maturity, not over-regulation.

---

## 7. How this brief fits within the AI Capability Framework

This brief applies the AI Capability Framework (2026 Edition) to data protection and information governance roles.

To deepen this work, teams may explore:

- the full AI Capability Framework (PDF)
- Practice Guides focused on governance and high-risk contexts
- the Application Handbook for DPIA and governance integration
- facilitated workshops on AI and data risk

The Framework provides structure.  
Data protection and governance teams provide trust, legality, and accountability.
