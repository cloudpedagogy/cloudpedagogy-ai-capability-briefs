## 1. What this brief is for

This brief is for public health professionals and leaders working in contexts where artificial intelligence increasingly supports analysis, modelling, communication, planning, and decision-making that affect populations rather than individuals.

It is intended for:

- public health practitioners and analysts  
- programme and policy leads  
- health researchers and evidence synthesis teams  
- public health educators and trainers  
- leaders in health agencies, NGOs, and public bodies  

This is not a technical guide to analytics or modelling tools.  
It is a capability briefing designed to support sound judgement, ethical awareness, and accountable decision-making when AI is used in public health work.

## 2. Why AI capability matters in public health

AI is already influencing public health practice through:

- data analysis and surveillance  
- modelling and scenario planning  
- evidence synthesis and reporting  
- risk communication and public messaging  
- prioritisation of interventions and resources  

These uses can improve insight and speed, but they also raise significant ethical, equity, and governance challenges. In public health, errors, bias, or overconfidence can scale rapidly and affect trust, wellbeing, and lives.

AI capability in public health is therefore not optional. It is essential for ensuring that AI:

- supports sound public health judgement  
- does not amplify inequities or blind spots  
- remains transparent and accountable to the public  

---

## 3. Common risks and blind spots in public health AI use

Across public health contexts, recurring risks appear:

- **Model overconfidence:** treating AI-generated outputs as predictive certainty rather than informed estimates  
- **Data bias:** reinforcing existing inequities through incomplete or skewed datasets  
- **Opacity:** difficulty explaining AI-informed decisions to non-technical stakeholders or the public  
- **Context loss:** applying models without sufficient understanding of local realities  
- **Ethical drift:** focusing on efficiency at the expense of fairness or consent  
- **Public trust erosion:** decisions perceived as automated, remote, or unaccountable  

These risks arise when AI capability is underdeveloped at organisational and leadership levels.

## 4. Applying the six domains of AI capability in public health

The AI Capability Framework provides a structured way to integrate AI into public health responsibly.

### 4.1 AI Awareness & Orientation

Public health professionals need a clear understanding of what AI models can and cannot do.

This includes:

- recognising uncertainty and limitations in AI-supported analysis  
- understanding assumptions embedded in data and models  
- avoiding the framing of AI outputs as objective or definitive  

This domain supports critical interpretation, not blind adoption.

---

### 4.2 Human–AI Co-Agency

In public health, accountability must remain human-led.

AI capability here involves:

- clarifying where human judgement overrides model outputs  
- ensuring professionals remain responsible for interpretation and action  
- resisting pressure to defer decisions to automated systems  

Clear co-agency protects both populations and practitioners.

---

### 4.3 Applied Practice & Innovation

AI can support innovation in public health when used intentionally.

This may include:

- exploring scenarios and projections to inform planning  
- supporting rapid evidence synthesis during emerging situations  
- identifying patterns that warrant further human investigation  

Innovation becomes valuable when AI outputs are treated as inputs to judgement, not replacements for it.

---

### 4.4 Ethics, Equity & Impact

Public health decisions shape population outcomes.

AI capability in this domain requires:

- examining who benefits and who may be disadvantaged  
- recognising how data gaps reflect structural inequities  
- anticipating downstream social and ethical consequences  

Ethical public health practice requires equity-aware AI use, not neutral assumptions.

---

### 4.5 Decision-Making & Governance

Public health decisions are subject to scrutiny.

AI capability here involves:

- documenting how AI-informed insights influenced decisions  
- ensuring transparency for internal review and public accountability  
- aligning practice with legal, ethical, and professional standards  

Good governance supports trust and defensibility.

---

### 4.6 Reflection, Learning & Renewal

Public health contexts evolve rapidly.

Capability is strengthened when teams:

- review the impact of AI-informed decisions  
- learn from successes and failures  
- update practices as data, tools, and societal expectations change  

This domain ensures AI use remains adaptive and responsible.

---

## 5. Practical actions for public health teams

The following actions support responsible AI capability in public health:

- **Treat AI outputs as advisory**  
  Use them to inform, not determine, decisions.

- **Interrogate data sources**  
  Understand whose data is represented and whose is missing.

- **Make assumptions explicit**  
  Surface model limitations in decision discussions.

- **Embed equity checks**  
  Assess differential impacts on communities and populations.

- **Document decision rationale**  
  Record how AI-informed insights were weighed.

- **Communicate transparently**  
  Explain AI use clearly to stakeholders and the public.

---

## 6. Signals of mature AI capability in public health

Public health organisations with strong AI capability typically demonstrate:

- clear human ownership of decisions  
- transparent communication about uncertainty  
- consistent ethical and equity considerations  
- confidence in public and stakeholder engagement  
- learning-oriented responses to emerging challenges  
- trust sustained through accountability and openness  

These signals reflect public health maturity, not technological sophistication.

## 7. How this brief fits within the AI Capability Framework

This brief applies the AI Capability Framework (2026 Edition) to public health practice.

To deepen this work, teams may explore:

- the full AI Capability Framework (PDF)  
- the Application Handbook for implementation guidance  
- Practice Guides focused on high-impact and public-sector contexts  
- facilitated workshops on AI capability in public health  

The Framework provides structure.  
Public health professionals provide contextual judgement and ethical responsibility.
