## 1. What this brief is for

This brief is for Public Health Communication, Engagement, Media, and Knowledge Translation teams responsible for communicating health evidence, guidance, and policy to the public and stakeholders in contexts where artificial intelligence increasingly shapes content creation, analysis, and dissemination.

It is intended for teams involved in:

- public health messaging and campaigns  
- risk communication and behaviour change initiatives  
- media relations and public-facing content  
- translation of evidence into accessible formats  
- communication during outbreaks, emergencies, or crises  

This is not a technical guide to AI writing tools or social media analytics.  
It is a capability briefing to support credibility, ethical judgement, and defensible decision-making when AI becomes part of public health communication practice.

## 2. Why AI capability matters for public health communication

AI is increasingly used to:

- draft and adapt public health messages  
- summarise evidence for non-specialist audiences  
- analyse sentiment and engagement  
- scale communication across channels and populations  

Public health communication operates at the intersection of evidence, trust, and behaviour. AI-assisted communication decisions can:

- influence population behaviour at scale  
- shape public understanding of risk and uncertainty  
- affect trust in public health institutions  
- amplify or reduce misinformation  

Without explicit AI capability, communication risks becoming faster but less trustworthy, more persuasive but less responsible.

AI capability ensures that efficiency gains do not come at the cost of accuracy, nuance, or public confidence.

## 3. Common risks and blind spots in AI-supported public health communication

Across public health contexts, recurring challenges appear:

- **Oversimplification:** AI-generated messages flattening uncertainty or nuance  
- **False authority:** fluent outputs interpreted as definitive guidance  
- **Tone mismatch:** messaging insensitive to community context or trauma  
- **Misinformation amplification:** AI repeating or reinforcing flawed narratives  
- **Equity gaps:** messages optimised for dominant audiences only  
- **Transparency loss:** unclear use of AI in message creation  

These risks can rapidly undermine trust, especially during high-stakes situations.

---

## 4. Applying the six domains of AI capability in public health communication

The AI Capability Framework provides a principled structure for responsible AI use in health messaging and engagement.

### 4.1 AI Awareness & Orientation

Communication teams need a grounded understanding of how AI generates language and narratives.

This includes:

- recognising persuasive tendencies in AI-generated text  
- understanding limitations in conveying uncertainty and evidence strength  
- avoiding assumptions that fluent language equals accurate communication  

This domain supports critical editorial judgement.

---

### 4.2 Human–AI Co-Agency

Responsibility for public health messaging must remain human-led.

AI capability here involves:

- ensuring humans retain ownership of content and claims  
- treating AI outputs as drafts requiring expert review  
- resisting pressure to automate communication without oversight  

Clear co-agency protects accountability and trust.

---

### 4.3 Applied Practice & Innovation

AI can support scalable, responsive communication when used deliberately.

This domain supports:

- rapid drafting and adaptation with expert validation  
- testing alternative framings for clarity and accessibility  
- supporting multilingual or accessible communication  

Innovation is beneficial when accuracy and context remain paramount.

---

### 4.4 Ethics, Equity & Impact

Public health communication has ethical obligations to fairness and care.

AI capability in this domain includes:

- recognising how messaging may affect different communities  
- avoiding stigmatising or alarmist narratives  
- ensuring vulnerable or marginalised groups are not excluded  

Ethical communication requires sensitivity to power, fear, and trust.

---

### 4.5 Decision-Making & Governance

Public health messages are often scrutinised.

AI capability here involves:

- documenting how AI was used in message development  
- aligning communication with evidence standards and policy  
- supporting defensible explanations under public or media challenge  

Good governance underpins confidence in public health advice.

---

### 4.6 Reflection, Learning & Renewal

Public communication environments evolve rapidly.

Capability is strengthened when teams:

- review the impact and reception of AI-assisted messaging  
- learn from public feedback and misinformation dynamics  
- update practices as evidence and tools change  

This domain supports resilient, trusted communication practice.

---

## 5. Practical actions for public health communication teams

The following actions strengthen AI capability in communication roles:

- **Treat AI outputs as drafts**  
  Apply rigorous editorial and evidence review.

- **Make uncertainty visible**  
  Communicate what is known, unknown, and evolving.

- **Protect tone and context**  
  Ensure sensitivity to audience experience and risk.

- **Be transparent where appropriate**  
  Clarify how AI supported content creation.

- **Monitor impact actively**  
  Track misunderstanding, misinformation, and trust signals.

- **Align closely with experts**  
  Maintain strong links to epidemiology and policy teams.

---

## 6. Signals of mature AI capability in public health communication

Public health communication systems with strong AI capability typically demonstrate:

- accurate, trustworthy public messaging  
- transparent handling of uncertainty  
- sensitivity to diverse communities  
- confidence under media and public scrutiny  
- resistance to misinformation amplification  
- continuous learning and improvement  

These signals reflect communication integrity, not message volume or speed.

## 7. How this brief fits within the AI Capability Framework

This brief applies the AI Capability Framework (2026 Edition) to public health communication contexts.

To deepen this work, teams may explore:

- the full AI Capability Framework (PDF)  
- Practice Guides focused on public impact and equity  
- the Application Handbook for organisational implementation  
- facilitated reviews of communication strategy and practice  

The Framework provides structure.  
Public health communication teams provide trust, clarity, and care.
