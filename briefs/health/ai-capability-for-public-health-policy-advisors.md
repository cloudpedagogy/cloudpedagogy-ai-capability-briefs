## 1. What this brief is for

This brief is for public health policy advisors working at the intersection of evidence, population health, and policy in contexts where artificial intelligence increasingly supports analysis, modelling, forecasting, and communication.

It is intended for roles involved in:

- population health policy and strategy  
- epidemiological analysis and modelling  
- health equity and prevention policy  
- advisory work to ministers, executives, and agencies  
- translating evidence into public-facing guidance  

This is not a technical guide to epidemiological AI models.  
It is a capability briefing to support sound judgement, equity-aware policy, and public trust when AI becomes part of public health policy work.

## 2. Why AI capability matters in public health policy

AI is increasingly used in public health to:

- model disease spread and intervention impact  
- synthesise large bodies of evidence  
- support surveillance and early warning  
- forecast demand and system pressure  
- generate policy briefings and communications  

Public health policy decisions:

- affect entire populations  
- shape resource allocation and prioritisation  
- disproportionately impact vulnerable groups  
- operate under intense political and public scrutiny  

AI capability ensures that AI supports evidence-informed policy without obscuring uncertainty, equity, or accountability.

## 3. Common risks and blind spots for public health policy advisors

Across public health contexts, recurring challenges appear:

- **False certainty:** probabilistic models presented as predictions.  
- **Equity masking:** aggregate data hiding subgroup impacts.  
- **Model dominance:** policy shaped by what is measurable rather than what matters.  
- **Translation loss:** nuance lost in AI-assisted briefing or messaging.  
- **Accountability blur:** unclear ownership of AI-informed policy recommendations.  
- **Public trust risk:** difficulty explaining AI-influenced decisions to the public.  

These risks arise when AI capability does not keep pace with policy responsibility.

## 4. Applying the six domains of AI capability in public health policy

The AI Capability Framework provides a population-aware structure for responsible policy advising.

### 4.1 AI Awareness & Orientation

Public health advisors need realistic understanding of AI-supported models.

This includes:

- recognising uncertainty, assumptions, and confidence intervals  
- understanding how data gaps reflect structural inequalities  
- avoiding assumptions that AI outputs are neutral or exhaustive  

This domain supports critical epidemiological judgement, not model endorsement.

---

### 4.2 Human–AI Co-Agency

Public health policy accountability must remain human-led.

AI capability here involves:

- ensuring advisors retain responsibility for policy recommendations  
- clarifying where AI informs versus determines policy options  
- resisting deference to model outputs under political pressure  

Clear co-agency protects professional and democratic accountability.

---

### 4.3 Applied Practice & Innovation

AI can support innovation in public health policy when used deliberately.

This domain supports:

- exploratory scenario modelling to test interventions  
- rapid synthesis to inform time-sensitive decisions  
- combining quantitative outputs with qualitative insight  

Innovation is valuable when AI augments judgement, not replaces it.

---

### 4.4 Ethics, Equity & Impact

Public health policy is inherently ethical.

AI capability in this domain includes:

- examining differential impacts across populations  
- recognising how AI may amplify existing health inequities  
- prioritising fairness, prevention, and long-term wellbeing  

Ethical policy requires equity-aware interpretation, not aggregate optimisation.

---

### 4.5 Decision-Making & Governance

Public health policy operates under legal, political, and public accountability.

AI capability here involves:

- documenting how AI influenced advice and recommendations  
- ensuring transparency in policy rationale  
- supporting explainability under scrutiny or inquiry  

Good governance sustains trust during crises and beyond.

---

### 4.6 Reflection, Learning & Renewal

Public health knowledge evolves continuously.

Capability is strengthened when advisors:

- review outcomes of AI-informed policy decisions  
- learn from unintended consequences  
- update practices as evidence and tools change  

This domain supports resilient and adaptive policy systems.

---

## 5. Practical actions for public health policy advisors

The following actions strengthen AI capability in public health policy work:

- **Interrogate assumptions**  
  Examine what models include, exclude, and prioritise.

- **Protect uncertainty**  
  Communicate limits and confidence clearly.

- **Centre equity explicitly**  
  Assess differential impacts across populations.

- **Document rationale**  
  Record how AI inputs informed recommendations.

- **Integrate multiple evidence forms**  
  Balance models with lived experience and qualitative insight.

- **Review impact over time**  
  Reflect on real-world outcomes, not just forecasts.

---

## 6. Signals of mature AI capability in public health policy

Public health policy environments with strong AI capability typically demonstrate:

- transparent handling of uncertainty  
- clear human ownership of recommendations  
- equity-aware interpretation of data  
- confidence under public and political scrutiny  
- integration of evidence, ethics, and judgement  
- learning-oriented policy cycles  

These signals reflect public health leadership maturity, not technical sophistication.

## 7. How this brief fits within the AI Capability Framework

This brief applies the AI Capability Framework (2026 Edition) to public health policy advisory work.

To deepen this approach, advisors may explore:

- the full AI Capability Framework (PDF)  
- Practice Guides focused on governance and public-impact contexts  
- the Application Handbook for policy integration pathways  
- facilitated scenario planning and reflection workshops  

The Framework provides structure.  
Public health policy advisors provide population-level judgement, equity, and trust.
