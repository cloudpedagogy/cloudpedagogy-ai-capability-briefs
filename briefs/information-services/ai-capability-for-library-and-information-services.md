## 1. What this brief is for

This brief is for Library & Information Services (LIS) professionals supporting learning, research, and knowledge stewardship in environments where artificial intelligence increasingly shapes information discovery, synthesis, authorship, and access.

It is intended for:

- academic and research librarians  
- information specialists and knowledge managers  
- scholarly communications and open research teams  
- digital scholarship and data services  
- copyright, licensing, and information literacy leads  

This is not a guide to specific discovery tools or AI products.  
It is a capability briefing to support confident advisory practice, boundary-setting, and institutional stewardship when AI becomes part of information work.

## 2. Why AI capability matters for library and information services

AI is transforming how information is:

- searched, summarised, and synthesised  
- cited, paraphrased, and reused  
- recommended and filtered  
- produced and disseminated  

Library and information services sit at a critical junction between:

- access and integrity  
- innovation and compliance  
- empowerment and protection  

Without clear AI capability, LIS teams risk:

- being asked to endorse practices they do not control  
- absorbing uncertainty from across the institution  
- responding reactively to copyright, attribution, or quality issues  

AI capability enables LIS professionals to act as trusted stewards and advisors, not informal arbiters of risk.

---

## 3. Common risks and blind spots for library and information services

Across institutions, recurring challenges emerge:

- **Attribution ambiguity:** unclear expectations around citation and AI-assisted paraphrasing  
- **Copyright uncertainty:** confusion about reuse, training data, and licensing boundaries  
- **Information quality drift:** reliance on AI-generated synthesis without source verification  
- **Role overload:** being positioned as default experts on all AI-related questions  
- **Equity concerns:** uneven access to guidance or support across user groups  
- **Policy–practice gaps:** institutional guidance not translating into information practice  

These issues reflect systemic capability gaps, not shortcomings in library practice.

## 4. Applying the six domains of AI capability in library and information services

The AI Capability Framework provides a shared language for LIS teams to support others while protecting core professional values.

### 4.1 AI Awareness & Orientation

LIS professionals need a grounded understanding of how AI interacts with information systems.

This includes:

- recognising limitations in AI-generated summaries and citations  
- understanding risks of fabricated or misattributed sources  
- avoiding assumptions that AI outputs are authoritative  

This domain supports critical information literacy, not tool endorsement.

---

### 4.2 Human–AI Co-Agency

Libraries play a key role in reinforcing human responsibility.

This involves:

- emphasising that users remain accountable for interpretation and attribution  
- supporting transparent disclosure of AI assistance where appropriate  
- resisting narratives that shift responsibility to systems  

Clear co-agency protects scholarly integrity.

---

### 4.3 Applied Practice & Innovation

AI can support innovation in information services when used intentionally.

This may include:

- exploring AI-assisted discovery as a starting point, not an endpoint  
- supporting digital scholarship and exploratory analysis  
- enabling new forms of access while maintaining quality standards  

Innovation is sustainable when LIS teams frame use, not police behaviour.

---

### 4.4 Ethics, Equity & Impact

Information systems shape who is seen, heard, and cited.

AI capability in this domain includes:

- recognising bias in training data and retrieval systems  
- considering whose knowledge is amplified or marginalised  
- supporting inclusive and equitable information practices  

Ethical stewardship remains central to LIS roles.

---

### 4.5 Decision-Making & Governance

LIS teams operate close to governance boundaries.

AI capability involves:

- aligning advice with institutional policy and legal requirements  
- supporting clear documentation of information practices  
- knowing when to escalate issues related to copyright, licensing, or risk  

Good governance protects both users and institutions.

---

### 4.6 Reflection, Learning & Renewal

Information practices evolve continuously.

LIS teams strengthen this domain by:

- reviewing how AI is changing user behaviour  
- updating guidance and literacy provision iteratively  
- sharing learning across professional networks  

This domain supports long-term relevance and credibility.

## 5. Practical actions for library and information services

The following actions support AI capability in LIS contexts:

- **Clarify advisory boundaries**  
  Define what LIS teams can advise on — and where responsibility sits elsewhere.

- **Promote critical information literacy**  
  Emphasise evaluation, sourcing, and attribution in AI-assisted work.

- **Align guidance with policy**  
  Ensure advice reflects institutional and legal expectations.

- **Support transparency**  
  Encourage appropriate disclosure of AI use in scholarly work.

- **Surface equity issues**  
  Monitor uneven impacts on access, visibility, and representation.

- **Share emerging patterns**  
  Feed insights back into institutional learning and governance.

---

## 6. Signals of mature AI capability in library and information services

LIS teams with strong AI capability typically demonstrate:

- confident, consistent advisory practice  
- clear boundaries around responsibility  
- emphasis on information quality and integrity  
- proactive engagement with ethical and equity concerns  
- trusted relationships across the institution  
- adaptive learning as information ecosystems change  

These signals reflect professional stewardship, not technological control.

## 7. How this brief fits within the AI Capability Framework

This brief applies the AI Capability Framework (2026 Edition) to library and information services.

To deepen this work, LIS teams may explore:

- the full AI Capability Framework (PDF)  
- Practice Guides related to teaching, research, and governance  
- the Application Handbook for institutional implementation  
- cross-functional workshops on AI and information practice  

The Framework provides structure.  
Library and information services provide knowledge stewardship and trust.
