## 1. What this brief is for

This brief is for archivists, records managers, information governance professionals, and custodians of institutional memory responsible for preserving, organising, and providing access to records in contexts where artificial intelligence increasingly supports classification, retrieval, appraisal, and interpretation.

It is intended for roles involved in:

- archives and special collections  
- records and information management  
- digital preservation and lifecycle governance  
- access, discovery, and disclosure  
- compliance with legal, regulatory, and ethical standards  

This is not a technical guide to AI classification tools or digital archiving platforms.  
It is a capability briefing to support professional judgement, evidential integrity, and defensible decision-making when AI intersects with records and archival practice.

## 2. Why AI capability matters for archives and records management

Archives and records underpin institutional accountability, memory, and trust. AI is increasingly used to:

- classify and describe large volumes of records  
- support search, retrieval, and discovery  
- assist appraisal and retention decisions  
- analyse historical or born-digital collections  

Decisions in archives and records management:

- shape what is preserved and what is lost  
- affect rights, transparency, and accountability  
- influence how history is interpreted  
- are subject to legal and public scrutiny  

Without explicit AI capability, there is a risk that AI use:

- obscures provenance and context  
- embeds bias into description or appraisal  
- undermines evidential value  
- weakens trust in records as authoritative sources  

AI capability ensures that AI supports archival practice without compromising integrity or professional standards.

---

## 3. Common risks and blind spots in AI-supported archival work

Across archives and records contexts, recurring challenges appear:

- **Context loss:** AI-generated metadata flattening provenance and meaning  
- **Bias amplification:** historical inequities reinforced through automated description  
- **Opacity:** unclear how AI decisions were made or trained  
- **Appraisal drift:** retention decisions subtly reshaped by optimisation logic  
- **Access distortion:** discoverability favouring dominant narratives  
- **Authenticity risk:** confusion between generated interpretation and original record  

These risks directly affect evidential reliability and public trust.

## 4. Applying the six domains of AI capability in archives and records management

The AI Capability Framework provides a principled structure for integrating AI into trust-critical information stewardship.

### 4.1 AI Awareness & Orientation

Information professionals need a clear understanding of how AI processes records and metadata.

This includes:

- recognising pattern-based classification and clustering  
- understanding limits in contextual and historical interpretation  
- avoiding assumptions that AI description equals authoritative description  

This domain supports professional scepticism and care.

---

### 4.2 Human–AI Co-Agency

Custodianship and accountability must remain human-led.

AI capability here involves:

- ensuring archivists retain authority over appraisal and description  
- treating AI outputs as aids, not determinations  
- maintaining clear responsibility for records decisions  

Clear co-agency preserves professional accountability.

---

### 4.3 Applied Practice & Innovation

AI can support archival practice when used deliberately.

This domain supports:

- managing scale in born-digital collections  
- enhancing discovery with professional oversight  
- supporting exploratory analysis without replacing judgement  

Innovation must reinforce, not erode, archival principles.

---

### 4.4 Ethics, Equity & Impact

Archives shape memory and power.

AI capability in this domain includes:

- recognising how AI may marginalise certain voices or histories  
- addressing bias in description, access, and appraisal  
- ensuring respectful treatment of sensitive or contested records  

Ethical stewardship is foundational to archival trust.

---

### 4.5 Decision-Making & Governance

Records and archives operate within strict governance frameworks.

AI capability here involves:

- documenting how AI influenced archival decisions  
- aligning AI use with legal, regulatory, and professional standards  
- supporting defensible decisions under audit or challenge  

Good governance sustains the authority of the archive.

---

### 4.6 Reflection, Learning & Renewal

Information practices evolve alongside technology.

Capability is strengthened when professionals:

- review the impact of AI on access, interpretation, and trust  
- learn from errors, challenges, or community feedback  
- update practices as standards and expectations evolve  

This domain supports resilient, future-ready stewardship.

## 5. Practical actions for archives and records management professionals

The following actions strengthen AI capability in archival contexts:

- **Preserve provenance explicitly**  
  Ensure context is not lost through automation.

- **Treat AI metadata as provisional**  
  Apply professional review and correction.

- **Surface bias deliberately**  
  Examine whose records are prioritised or marginalised.

- **Document AI use**  
  Record where and how AI supported archival processes.

- **Align with professional standards**  
  Anchor AI use in established archival principles.

- **Review impact on access and trust**  
  Monitor how users experience AI-supported discovery.

---

## 6. Signals of mature AI capability in archives and records management

Archives and records services with strong AI capability typically demonstrate:

- preserved evidential integrity  
- transparent and explainable archival decisions  
- ethical sensitivity to representation and power  
- confidence under legal or public scrutiny  
- trust from users and communities  
- reflective, standards-led practice  

These signals reflect custodial maturity, not technological adoption.

## 7. How this brief fits within the AI Capability Framework

This brief applies the AI Capability Framework (2026 Edition) to archives and records management contexts.

To deepen this work, services may explore:

- the full AI Capability Framework (PDF)  
- Practice Guides focused on governance and public impact  
- the Application Handbook for organisational implementation  
- facilitated reviews of AI-supported information practices  

The Framework provides structure.  
Archives and records management provide memory, evidence, and trust.
