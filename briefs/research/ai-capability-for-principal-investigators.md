## 1. What this brief is for

This brief is for Principal Investigators (PIs) responsible for leading research projects, securing funding, overseeing teams, and ensuring the quality, integrity, and impact of research in contexts where artificial intelligence is increasingly embedded in everyday research practice.

It is intended for PIs working across disciplines and sectors, including:

- academic research projects  
- applied and translational research  
- interdisciplinary and collaborative programmes  
- funder- or policy-driven research initiatives  

This is not a guide to research tools or grant-writing software.  
It is a capability briefing to support confident leadership, ethical responsibility, and defensible decision-making when AI becomes part of research workflows.

## 2. Why AI capability matters for Principal Investigators

AI is already influencing how research teams:

- review and synthesise literature  
- explore data and generate hypotheses  
- draft reports, papers, and funding applications  
- manage projects, timelines, and collaboration  

For PIs, these developments affect core responsibilities:

- research quality and rigour  
- authorship and contribution  
- ethical approval and data protection  
- accountability to funders, institutions, and the public  

Without deliberate AI capability, AI use can quietly reshape research practice in ways that are inconsistent, risky, or misaligned with project values.  
AI capability allows PIs to lead research teams with clarity rather than leaving practices to evolve informally.

## 3. Common risks and blind spots for Principal Investigators

Across research environments, recurring challenges appear:

- **Invisible AI use:** team members using AI without shared discussion or agreement  
- **Authorship ambiguity:** unclear boundaries between human contribution and AI assistance  
- **Epistemic risk:** AI-generated synthesis treated as authoritative rather than provisional  
- **Data exposure:** sensitive or unpublished data used inappropriately  
- **Uneven expectations:** early-career researchers uncertain about acceptable practice  
- **Funder misalignment:** AI use not anticipated in project design or reporting  

These risks are rarely intentional.  
They arise when leadership capability does not keep pace with practice.

## 4. Applying the six domains of AI capability in PI leadership

The AI Capability Framework supports PIs in leading research responsibly without becoming technical specialists.

### 4.1 AI Awareness & Orientation

PIs need a shared, realistic understanding of how AI behaves in research contexts.

This includes:

- recognising limitations of AI-supported analysis and synthesis  
- understanding where bias, error, or hallucination are likely  
- avoiding assumptions that AI outputs are neutral or complete  

This domain supports critical oversight, not technical depth.

---

### 4.2 Human–AI Co-Agency

Research accountability ultimately sits with the PI.

AI capability here involves:

- clarifying that AI supports, but does not own, intellectual decisions  
- defining expectations around authorship, validation, and interpretation  
- reinforcing that responsibility for research quality remains human-led  

Clear co-agency protects both the research team and the PI.

---

### 4.3 Applied Practice & Innovation

AI can legitimately support research innovation.

This domain enables:

- exploratory use of AI to test ideas or perspectives  
- efficiency gains in low-risk tasks  
- interdisciplinary translation and synthesis  

Innovation becomes problematic only when AI use is uncoordinated or undocumented.

---

### 4.4 Ethics, Equity & Impact

PIs are accountable for ethical research conduct.

AI capability in this domain includes:

- safeguarding participant and data confidentiality  
- recognising bias introduced through AI-supported methods  
- ensuring early-career researchers are not pressured into opaque practices  

Ethical leadership requires proactive judgement, not retrospective justification.

---

### 4.5 Decision-Making & Governance

PIs operate within institutional, funder, and regulatory frameworks.

This domain involves:

- ensuring AI use aligns with ethics approval and data governance  
- documenting AI-related decisions where relevant  
- preparing defensible responses to funders, reviewers, and auditors  

Good governance supports confidence and credibility.

---

### 4.6 Reflection, Learning & Renewal

Research practices evolve over time.

PIs strengthen capability by:

- reviewing how AI use shapes research quality and team practice  
- learning from emerging norms across the sector  
- updating expectations as tools and guidance change  

This domain supports sustainable research leadership.

## 5. Practical actions for Principal Investigators

The following actions strengthen AI capability within research teams:

- **Make AI use discussable**  
  Create space for open conversation about how AI is being used.

- **Set shared expectations**  
  Clarify acceptable and unacceptable uses early in the project.

- **Protect intellectual responsibility**  
  Ensure human validation and interpretation remain central.

- **Align with ethics and governance**  
  Check AI use against approvals, funder terms, and data policies.

- **Support team capability**  
  Provide guidance for early-career researchers and collaborators.

- **Document key decisions**  
  Keep brief records of how AI considerations informed practice.

---

## 6. Signals of mature AI capability in PI-led research

Research projects with strong AI capability typically demonstrate:

- transparent discussion of AI use  
- clear ownership of intellectual decisions  
- consistent practice across the research team  
- ethical handling of data and materials  
- confidence in funder and peer scrutiny  
- adaptive learning as research evolves  

These signals reflect research leadership maturity, not technical sophistication.

## 7. How this brief fits within the AI Capability Framework

This brief applies the AI Capability Framework (2026 Edition) to the leadership role of Principal Investigators.

To deepen this work, PIs may explore:

- the full AI Capability Framework (PDF)  
- Practice Guides focused on research and governance  
- the Application Handbook for structured implementation  
- facilitated discussions within research teams or departments  

The Framework provides structure.  
Principal Investigators provide intellectual leadership and accountability.
