## 1. What this brief is for

This brief is for Communications and Public Engagement teams responsible for how organisations communicate, represent themselves, and build trust with external audiences in contexts where artificial intelligence increasingly shapes content creation, analysis, targeting, and interaction.

It is intended for teams involved in:

- corporate and institutional communications
- public engagement and outreach
- media relations and reputation management
- digital communications and social media
- stakeholder, community, and partner engagement

This is not a content marketing guide or an AI copywriting manual.  
It is a capability briefing to support credibility, ethical judgement, and public trust when AI becomes part of communication practice.

---

## 2. Why AI capability matters for communications and engagement

AI is already influencing communications work by:

- drafting and editing content at speed
- summarising complex material for public audiences
- analysing engagement and sentiment
- supporting targeting, scheduling, and optimisation

While these capabilities can increase efficiency, they also create heightened risk:

- loss of authenticity or voice
- amplification of bias or misinformation
- erosion of trust if AI use is perceived as manipulative
- reputational harm through opaque or inappropriate use

For communications and engagement teams, trust is the product.  
AI capability ensures that efficiency gains do not undermine credibility, transparency, or ethical responsibility.

---

## 3. Common risks and blind spots for communications teams

Across sectors, recurring challenges emerge:

- **Voice dilution:** generic or flattened messaging that lacks institutional identity.
- **Opacity:** AI-assisted content presented as fully human-authored without disclosure.
- **Bias amplification:** unexamined assumptions shaping messaging or targeting.
- **Speed over judgement:** publishing quickly without adequate reflection.
- **Audience misalignment:** AI-driven optimisation prioritising metrics over meaning.
- **Reputational exposure:** AI use becoming a liability when challenged publicly.

These risks reflect capability gaps in judgement and governance, not technical failure.

## 4. Applying the six domains of AI capability in communications and engagement

The AI Capability Framework provides a values-based structure for responsible communication practice.

### 4.1 AI Awareness & Orientation

Communications teams need realistic understanding of how AI shapes content and interpretation.

This includes:

- recognising that AI-generated text reflects patterns, not intent
- understanding limitations in nuance, tone, and context
- avoiding assumptions that AI outputs reflect organisational values

This domain supports editorial judgement, not automation.

---

### 4.2 Human–AI Co-Agency

Communications accountability must remain human-led.

AI capability here involves:

- ensuring humans retain responsibility for message intent and impact
- clarifying where AI assists drafting versus shaping narrative
- resisting pressure to outsource voice or judgement to systems

Clear co-agency protects authenticity and accountability.

---

### 4.3 Applied Practice & Innovation

AI can support innovation in engagement when used deliberately.

This domain supports:

- testing alternative framings or formats
- supporting accessibility and clarity
- exploring new engagement channels responsibly

Innovation is valuable when AI is a support for creativity, not a substitute for meaning.

---

### 4.4 Ethics, Equity & Impact

Communications shape perception and power.

AI capability in this domain includes:

- considering how messages affect different audiences
- recognising potential exclusion or misrepresentation
- avoiding manipulative or deceptive practices

Ethical communication requires foresight, not just compliance.

---

### 4.5 Decision-Making & Governance

Communications decisions carry reputational risk.

AI capability here involves:

- documenting how AI is used in content creation or analysis
- aligning practice with organisational values and public commitments
- ensuring defensible responses if AI use is questioned externally

Good governance supports confidence under scrutiny.

---

### 4.6 Reflection, Learning & Renewal

Public expectations evolve rapidly.

Capability is strengthened when teams:

- review audience response to AI-assisted communication
- learn from missteps as well as successes
- adapt practice as norms and trust expectations change

This domain supports resilience and credibility over time.

---

## 5. Practical actions for communications and engagement teams

The following actions strengthen AI capability in communications contexts:

- **Protect organisational voice**  
  Ensure AI-assisted content reflects values, tone, and intent.

- **Make editorial responsibility explicit**  
  Clarify who owns final messaging decisions.

- **Use AI as a drafting aid, not an author**  
  Treat outputs as inputs for human judgement.

- **Consider transparency carefully**  
  Decide when and how to disclose AI use appropriately.

- **Assess audience impact**  
  Reflect on how messages may land across communities.

- **Document communication rationale**  
  Keep brief records of how AI informed decisions.

---

## 6. Signals of mature AI capability in communications and engagement

Teams with strong AI capability typically demonstrate:

- consistent, authentic organisational voice
- confidence in editorial judgement
- transparent handling of AI-related questions
- sensitivity to audience diversity and trust
- reduced reputational risk under scrutiny
- adaptive learning as expectations evolve

These signals reflect communications maturity, not technical sophistication.

To deepen this work, teams may explore:

- the full AI Capability Framework (PDF)
- Practice Guides related to governance and public-impact contexts
- the Application Handbook for organisational implementation
- facilitated discussions on AI, trust, and public communication

The Framework provides structure.  
Communications teams provide voice, trust, and public accountability.
