## 1. What this brief is for

This brief is for Learning Designers, Instructional Designers, and educational design specialists who shape learning experiences, assessment structures, and curriculum coherence in contexts where artificial intelligence increasingly influences content creation, assessment design, feedback, and learner support.

It is intended for designers working in:

- higher education and further education  
- online and blended learning programmes  
- professional and continuing education  
- curriculum renewal and programme redesign initiatives  

This is not a tool guide or a prompt library.  
It is a capability briefing to support sound design judgement, ethical responsibility, and defensible decision-making when AI becomes embedded in learning design practice.

## 2. Why AI capability matters for learning design

AI is rapidly reshaping how learning designs are produced and evaluated. Designers are now asked to:

- review AI-generated learning outcomes, content, and activities  
- redesign assessment to remain meaningful in AI-rich environments  
- advise academic staff on acceptable and effective AI use  
- balance innovation with accessibility, integrity, and inclusion  

Because learning designers operate *upstream* of teaching and assessment, their decisions are inherited by:

- teaching staff  
- students  
- quality assurance processes  
- external reviewers and accrediting bodies  

AI capability ensures that learning design choices remain pedagogically intentional rather than becoming reactive responses to technology pressure.

## 3. Common risks and blind spots in AI-supported learning design

Across institutions, recurring challenges appear:

- **Design acceleration without reflection:** AI-generated structures adopted without pedagogical scrutiny  
- **Assessment erosion:** tasks redesigned superficially rather than rethinking what learning is evidenced  
- **Hidden assumptions:** AI outputs embedding narrow or normative learning models  
- **Equity gaps:** designs assuming high AI access or confidence among learners  
- **Role confusion:** designers positioned as AI enforcers rather than pedagogical partners  
- **Over-standardisation:** loss of disciplinary nuance through generic AI-informed templates  

These risks arise when AI is treated as a productivity tool rather than a design influence that requires judgement.

## 4. Applying the six domains of AI capability in learning design

The AI Capability Framework provides learning designers with a structured lens for integrating AI without weakening pedagogy or trust.

### 4.1 AI Awareness & Orientation

Learning designers need a grounded understanding of how AI systems generate content and recommendations.

This includes:

- recognising the generic nature of AI-generated learning structures  
- understanding where AI tends to reproduce dominant pedagogical norms  
- avoiding assumptions that AI outputs reflect educational best practice  

This domain supports informed critique, not technical expertise.

---

### 4.2 Human–AI Co-Agency

Design responsibility must remain human-led.

AI capability here involves:

- treating AI outputs as design inputs, not design decisions  
- retaining ownership of pedagogical framing and intent  
- ensuring learning outcomes and assessment logic remain human-authored  

Clear co-agency protects the integrity of curriculum design.

---

### 4.3 Applied Practice & Innovation

AI can support learning design innovation when used deliberately.

This domain supports:

- rapid exploration of alternative design options  
- scenario testing of assessment approaches  
- support for inclusive and flexible learning pathways  

Innovation becomes risky when AI-generated designs are adopted without validation or adaptation.

---

### 4.4 Ethics, Equity & Impact

Learning design decisions shape learner experience at scale.

AI capability in this domain includes:

- assessing whether designs disadvantage particular learner groups  
- considering accessibility, digital confidence, and support needs  
- recognising how AI-informed design choices affect assessment fairness  

Ethical design requires anticipation of downstream impact, not retrospective adjustment.

---

### 4.5 Decision-Making & Governance

Learning designers operate within quality assurance and governance frameworks.

AI capability here involves:

- documenting design rationales where AI influences decisions  
- aligning AI-aware designs with institutional policy and standards  
- supporting defensible explanations during review or accreditation  

Good governance strengthens confidence in design innovation.

---

### 4.6 Reflection, Learning & Renewal

Pedagogical norms evolve alongside technology.

Learning designers strengthen capability by:

- reviewing how AI-informed designs perform in practice  
- learning from student and staff feedback  
- updating design principles as expectations and tools change  

This domain supports sustainable, future-ready design practice.

## 5. Practical actions for learning designers and instructional designers

The following actions strengthen AI capability in learning design roles:

- **Interrogate AI-generated designs**  
  Treat AI outputs as drafts requiring pedagogical judgement.

- **Protect assessment intent**  
  Ensure tasks still evidence the learning that matters.

- **Design for transparency**  
  Make expectations about AI use explicit for staff and students.

- **Embed equity checks**  
  Assess access, inclusion, and unintended disadvantage.

- **Document key design decisions**  
  Record how AI considerations informed curriculum choices.

- **Support staff capability**  
  Position AI as a design conversation, not a compliance issue.

---

## 6. Signals of mature AI capability in learning design

Learning design teams with strong AI capability typically demonstrate:

- intentional, transparent use of AI in design workflows  
- assessments aligned to judgement, synthesis, and application  
- confidence in supporting academic staff  
- consistency across modules and programmes  
- defensible design rationales under review  
- continuous learning and adaptation  

These signals reflect pedagogical maturity, not technological adoption.

## 7. How this brief fits within the AI Capability Framework

This brief applies the AI Capability Framework (2026 Edition) to learning design and instructional design practice.

To deepen this work, designers may explore:

- the full AI Capability Framework (PDF)  
- Practice Guides related to teaching, assessment, and governance  
- the Application Handbook for curriculum-level implementation  
- facilitated design sprints or programme-level reviews  

The Framework provides structure.  
Learning designers provide pedagogical judgement and coherence.
