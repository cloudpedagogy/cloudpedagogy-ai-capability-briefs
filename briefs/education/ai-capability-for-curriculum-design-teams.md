## 1. What this brief is for

This brief is for curriculum design teams responsible for shaping programmes, modules, learning outcomes, assessment strategies, and learning activities in contexts where artificial intelligence is now part of how students learn and work.

It is intended for:

- curriculum designers and educational developers
- programme and module design teams
- academic developers and learning designers
- staff involved in programme approval and review

This is not a guide to AI tools or platforms.  
It is a capability briefing designed to support intentional, coherent curriculum design when AI is present across learning, assessment, and student practice.

## 2. Why AI capability matters in curriculum design

AI is already influencing:

- how students generate ideas, drafts, and plans
- how they study, revise, and seek feedback
- how learning outcomes are interpreted and demonstrated
- how assessments are completed and evaluated

For curriculum design teams, the challenge is no longer whether students will use AI, but whether curricula are designed with AI in mind or left to adapt informally.

Without AI capability at design stage:

- learning outcomes may become misaligned with assessment
- assessment tasks may unintentionally reward substitution over learning
- expectations around AI use may remain implicit or inconsistent
- programme coherence may erode over time

AI capability allows curriculum teams to design future-fit, defensible, and educationally sound curricula.

## 3. Common risks and blind spots in curriculum design

Across institutions, recurring issues appear when AI is not addressed deliberately in curriculum design:

- **Outcome–assessment mismatch:** assessments no longer reliably measure intended learning.
- **Implicit assumptions:** unspoken expectations about AI use left to staff or students to infer.
- **Patchwork design:** AI considerations addressed unevenly across modules.
- **Over-correction:** reactive redesigns driven by fear rather than pedagogy.
- **Equity gaps:** tasks that advantage students with higher digital confidence.
- **Design fatigue:** repeated local fixes instead of coherent programme-level design.

These issues are design problems, not disciplinary ones.

## 4. Applying the six domains of AI capability in curriculum design

The AI Capability Framework supports curriculum teams in embedding AI awareness without diluting academic standards.

### 4.1 AI Awareness & Orientation

Curriculum designers need a shared understanding of how AI affects learning processes.

This includes:

- recognising which learning outcomes are most affected by AI support
- understanding common AI limitations that influence student work
- avoiding assumptions that AI use is uniform or predictable

This domain informs design judgement, not technical detail.

---

### 4.2 Human–AI Co-Agency

Curriculum design defines where learning responsibility sits.

For design teams, this means:

- clarifying where human reasoning, creativity, and judgement are essential
- designing tasks that require meaningful student agency
- ensuring AI supports learning rather than replacing it

Explicit co-agency strengthens educational integrity.

---

### 4.3 Applied Practice & Innovation

AI capability enables curriculum innovation when used intentionally.

This may include:

- designing assessments that value interpretation, reflection, and synthesis
- integrating AI-aware learning activities where appropriate
- encouraging experimentation within shared design principles

Innovation is most effective when it is designed, not improvised.

---

### 4.4 Ethics, Equity & Impact

Curriculum decisions shape inclusion and fairness.

Design teams should consider:

- whether AI-aware designs support diverse learners
- how access, confidence, and support vary across student groups
- the broader impact of curriculum choices on graduate capability

Ethical curriculum design anticipates impact rather than responding after the fact.

---

### 4.5 Decision-Making & Governance

Curriculum design sits within formal approval and review structures.

AI capability in this domain involves:

- documenting how AI considerations informed design decisions
- aligning curriculum choices with institutional guidance
- ensuring defensibility to reviewers, examiners, and accrediting bodies

Good governance strengthens confidence in design innovation.

---

### 4.6 Reflection, Learning & Renewal

Curriculum design is iterative.

AI capability is strengthened when teams:

- review how AI-aware designs perform in practice
- share insights across programmes and faculties
- update designs as contexts and expectations evolve

This domain supports sustainable curriculum quality.

---

## 5. Practical actions for curriculum design teams

The following actions support AI capability at design stage:

- **Audit learning outcomes**  
  Identify where AI use meaningfully affects outcome demonstration.

- **Review assessment coherence**  
  Check whether tasks still align with intended learning in an AI-rich context.

- **Make expectations explicit**  
  Design guidance for staff and students into curriculum documentation.

- **Design for judgement**  
  Emphasise tasks that require reasoning, evaluation, and reflection.

- **Support staff capability**  
  Provide shared principles and examples rather than isolated fixes.

- **Document design rationale**  
  Record how AI considerations shaped curriculum decisions.

---

## 6. Signals of mature AI capability in curriculum design

Curricula with strong AI capability typically show:

- clear alignment between outcomes, teaching, and assessment
- explicit and consistent expectations around AI use
- assessments that foreground human judgement
- reduced reliance on reactive redesign
- confidence during programme approval and review
- shared design language across teams

These signals reflect design maturity, not restriction.

---

## 7. How this brief fits within the AI Capability Framework

This brief applies the AI Capability Framework (2026 Edition) to curriculum design work.

To deepen this approach, curriculum teams may explore:

- the full AI Capability Framework (PDF)
- the Application Handbook for structured design processes
- Practice Guides focused on teaching and curriculum
- facilitated curriculum design workshops

The Framework provides structure.  
Curriculum teams provide pedagogical intent and coherence.
