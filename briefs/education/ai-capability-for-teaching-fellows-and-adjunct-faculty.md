## 1. What this brief is for

This brief is for Teaching Fellows, Adjunct Faculty, Associate Lecturers, and sessional or fixed-term teaching staff who deliver teaching and assessment in contexts where artificial intelligence is increasingly part of students’ learning practices and institutional expectations.

It is intended for educators who:

- teach modules designed by others  
- deliver teaching across multiple programmes or institutions  
- work under time-limited or fractional contracts  
- have limited influence over programme-level policy  

This is not a training manual or a set of classroom rules.  
It is a capability briefing to support confident judgement, professional integrity, and defensible teaching practice when AI becomes part of everyday learning and assessment.

## 2. Why AI capability matters for teaching fellows and adjunct faculty

Teaching fellows and adjunct staff are often closest to day-to-day student practice, yet furthest from institutional decision-making.

In AI-rich learning environments, they are frequently expected to:

- respond to student AI use without clear guidance  
- interpret evolving institutional policy in real time  
- maintain assessment integrity under pressure  
- provide feedback on work that may be AI-assisted  
- answer student questions about “what is allowed”  

Without explicit AI capability, this can lead to:

- inconsistent expectations across modules  
- heightened workload and uncertainty  
- risk exposure without decision authority  
- erosion of professional confidence  

AI capability enables teaching staff to act with clarity and integrity even when policy, design, or support is uneven.

## 3. Common risks and blind spots for teaching fellows and adjunct faculty

Across institutions, recurring challenges appear:

- **Policy ambiguity:** unclear or changing guidance about acceptable AI use  
- **Isolation:** limited access to support or peer discussion  
- **Assessment mismatch:** tasks that no longer reliably evidence learning  
- **Over-reliance on detection:** pressure to police AI use without tools or authority  
- **Equity concerns:** uneven student access to AI or guidance  
- **Role strain:** expectation to manage AI-related issues without recognition  

These risks are structural, not individual failings.

## 4. Applying the six domains of AI capability in teaching roles

The AI Capability Framework offers a way for teaching fellows and adjunct faculty to navigate AI responsibly within constrained roles.

### 4.1 AI Awareness & Orientation

Teaching staff need a practical understanding of how students use AI.

This includes:

- recognising common patterns of AI-assisted study and writing  
- understanding limitations of AI-generated work  
- avoiding assumptions that AI use is either universal or malicious  

This domain supports informed responses, not surveillance.

---

### 4.2 Human–AI Co-Agency

Teaching authority must remain human-led.

AI capability here involves:

- maintaining responsibility for academic judgement and feedback  
- ensuring learning outcomes remain focused on human understanding  
- resisting pressure to delegate judgement to detection systems  

Clear co-agency supports fair and defensible teaching decisions.

---

### 4.3 Applied Practice & Innovation

Teaching fellows often adapt materials in practice.

This domain supports:

- experimenting with teaching approaches that surface learning processes  
- adjusting activities to emphasise discussion, reflection, or application  
- using AI transparently to support preparation without misrepresentation  

Innovation is most effective when it aligns with learning intent rather than compliance pressure.

---

### 4.4 Ethics, Equity & Impact

Teaching roles shape student experience directly.

AI capability in this domain includes:

- recognising inequities in student access to AI tools or support  
- avoiding assumptions about intent or misconduct  
- supporting inclusive learning environments  

Ethical teaching requires sensitivity to context and power.

---

### 4.5 Decision-Making & Governance

Adjunct and sessional staff often operate without full governance authority.

AI capability here involves:

- knowing when to escalate AI-related concerns  
- documenting decisions and feedback clearly  
- aligning practice with available institutional guidance  

Good governance protects both staff and students.

---

### 4.6 Reflection, Learning & Renewal

Teaching practice evolves continuously.

Capability is strengthened when educators:

- reflect on how AI is affecting learning and assessment  
- share experiences with peers where possible  
- update approaches incrementally rather than reactively  

This domain supports professional resilience and confidence.

## 5. Practical actions for teaching fellows and adjunct faculty

The following actions support AI capability in teaching roles:

- **Seek clarity early**  
  Ask programme leaders or designers about expectations where possible.

- **Be transparent with students**  
  Communicate clearly about learning goals and acceptable AI use.

- **Focus feedback on learning**  
  Emphasise reasoning, understanding, and process.

- **Avoid default policing**  
  Use judgement rather than suspicion as a starting point.

- **Document concerns**  
  Keep brief records where AI-related issues arise.

- **Connect where possible**  
  Share insights with peers to reduce isolation.

---

## 6. Signals of mature AI capability in teaching roles

Teaching contexts with strong AI capability typically show:

- consistent expectations communicated to students  
- confident, fair assessment decisions  
- reduced reliance on detection or punitive measures  
- supportive learning environments  
- alignment between teaching practice and programme intent  
- reflective adaptation rather than crisis response  

These signals reflect professional judgement, not enforcement.

## 7. How this brief fits within the AI Capability Framework

This brief applies the AI Capability Framework (2026 Edition) to teaching fellow and adjunct faculty roles.

To deepen this work, educators may explore:

- the full AI Capability Framework (PDF)  
- Practice Guides focused on teaching and assessment  
- the Application Handbook for programme-level context  
- facilitated conversations within teaching teams  

The Framework provides structure.  
Teaching fellows and adjunct faculty provide frontline educational judgement.
