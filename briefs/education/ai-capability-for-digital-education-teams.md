## 1. What this brief is for

This brief is for Digital Education Teams responsible for enabling, supporting, and sustaining digital learning across programmes and faculties in contexts where artificial intelligence is now embedded in teaching, assessment, student support, and operational workflows.

It is intended for:

- digital education and learning technology teams
- learning technologists and educational technologists
- academic development and digital pedagogy teams
- staff supporting learning platforms, assessment systems, and digital workflows

This is not a technical manual or a product guide.  
It is a capability briefing designed to support confident, coherent, and responsible digital education practice when AI becomes part of everyday academic work.

## 2. Why AI capability matters for digital education teams

Digital education teams increasingly sit at the intersection of:

- academic practice and institutional policy
- innovation and risk management
- staff support and system governance

AI intensifies this position. Teams are often asked to:

- advise on acceptable AI use
- support staff experimenting with AI-aware teaching and assessment
- respond to concerns about integrity, privacy, or fairness
- translate policy into practical guidance

Without clear AI capability, digital education teams risk becoming:

- informal gatekeepers without authority
- reactive support services
- default owners of decisions that belong elsewhere

AI capability enables these teams to enable rather than absorb risk.

---

## 3. Common risks and blind spots for digital education teams

Across institutions, recurring challenges appear:

- **Role drift:** being positioned as decision-makers rather than enablers.
- **Policy translation gaps:** unclear pathways from guidance to practice.
- **Tool-centric thinking:** focusing on platforms rather than pedagogy and judgement.
- **Inconsistent advice:** different messages given to different teams.
- **Hidden labour:** absorbing institutional uncertainty through ad hoc support.
- **Boundary ambiguity:** unclear lines between academic, technical, and governance responsibility.

These issues reflect capability gaps, not individual failure.

## 4. Applying the six domains of AI capability in digital education teams

The AI Capability Framework provides a shared language that helps digital education teams support others without over-stepping.

### 4.1 AI Awareness & Orientation

Digital education teams need a grounded understanding of AI capabilities and limitations.

This includes:

- recognising where AI meaningfully affects teaching and assessment
- understanding common risks such as bias, hallucination, and over-confidence
- avoiding oversimplified narratives when advising staff

This domain supports credible guidance, not technical authority.

---

### 4.2 Human–AI Co-Agency

Digital education teams play a key role in clarifying responsibility.

This involves:

- reinforcing that academic judgement remains human-owned
- supporting staff to design transparent human–AI workflows
- avoiding implicit endorsement of inappropriate delegation to AI

Clear co-agency protects both staff and teams.

---

### 4.3 Applied Practice & Innovation

Digital education teams often enable experimentation.

AI capability supports:

- piloting AI-aware learning and assessment approaches
- sharing examples and patterns across programmes
- supporting innovation within agreed principles

Innovation becomes sustainable when teams act as connectors, not isolated problem-solvers.

---

### 4.4 Ethics, Equity & Impact

Digital education teams often see impacts first.

This domain includes:

- recognising accessibility and inclusion implications
- identifying uneven effects across disciplines or student groups
- surfacing ethical concerns early rather than post-incident

Capability here enables preventative support, not reactive fixes.

---

### 4.5 Decision-Making & Governance

Digital education teams operate close to governance boundaries.

AI capability involves:

- knowing when to escalate decisions
- supporting documentation and traceability
- aligning local advice with institutional expectations

Strong governance capability protects teams from becoming informal arbiters.

---

### 4.6 Reflection, Learning & Renewal

Digital education work is iterative.

Teams strengthen this domain by:

- reviewing patterns in staff questions and requests
- feeding insights back into institutional guidance
- supporting continuous improvement rather than one-off fixes

This sustains team effectiveness over time.

---

## 5. Practical actions for digital education teams

The following actions strengthen AI capability in digital education teams:

- **Clarify your enabling role**  
  Reinforce boundaries between support, advice, and decision-making.

- **Use a shared framework**  
  Apply the AI Capability Framework as a common reference point.

- **Standardise guidance where possible**  
  Reduce inconsistency by developing shared principles and FAQs.

- **Support staff capability**  
  Focus on building confidence and judgement, not just solving problems.

- **Escalate strategically**  
  Identify when issues require academic or governance leadership.

- **Document recurring issues**  
  Use patterns to inform institutional learning and policy refinement.

---

## 6. Signals of mature AI capability in digital education teams

Teams with strong AI capability typically demonstrate:

- consistent, confident advice across contexts
- clear boundaries around responsibility
- reduced reliance on ad hoc interventions
- constructive relationships with academic and governance colleagues
- early identification of ethical or equity concerns
- a culture of shared learning and improvement

These signals reflect enabling maturity, not control.

## 7. How this brief fits within the AI Capability Framework

This brief applies the AI Capability Framework (2026 Edition) to the work of digital education teams.

To deepen this approach, teams may explore:

- the full AI Capability Framework (PDF)
- the Application Handbook for operational translation
- Practice Guides related to teaching, assessment, and governance
- facilitated capability-building sessions or communities of practice

The Framework provides structure.  
Digital education teams provide translation, support, and coherence.
