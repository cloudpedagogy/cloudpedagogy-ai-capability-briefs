## 1. What this brief is for

This brief is for Emergency Planning, Resilience, Civil Contingencies, and Crisis Management teams responsible for preparing for, responding to, and recovering from emergencies in contexts where artificial intelligence increasingly supports forecasting, coordination, decision support, and communication.

It is intended for teams involved in:

- emergency preparedness and contingency planning  
- crisis response coordination  
- resilience and recovery planning  
- multi-agency and cross-sector collaboration  
- public warning and information systems  

This is not a technical guide to emergency modelling or command-and-control systems.  
It is a capability briefing to support judgement, accountability, and ethical responsibility when AI is used in time-critical, high-impact public service contexts.

## 2. Why AI capability matters for emergency planning and resilience

AI is increasingly used to:

- support risk modelling and scenario forecasting  
- analyse real-time data during incidents  
- prioritise response actions and resource deployment  
- assist public communication under pressure  

In emergency contexts, decisions are often:

- time-critical  
- made under uncertainty  
- difficult or impossible to reverse  
- highly visible to the public and media  

Errors, bias, or over-reliance on AI in these situations can rapidly escalate harm.

AI capability ensures that emergency teams use AI as *decision support*, not decision replacement, maintaining human authority and accountability under pressure.

---

## 3. Common risks and blind spots in AI-supported emergency response

Across emergency and resilience contexts, recurring challenges appear:

- **Automation bias:** deferring to AI outputs during stress or urgency  
- **False precision:** treating forecasts or models as predictive certainty  
- **Data distortion:** incomplete or biased data shaping response priorities  
- **Responsibility diffusion:** unclear ownership of AI-influenced decisions  
- **Communication risk:** AI-generated messaging lacking sensitivity or context  
- **Crisis normalisation:** emergency AI practices becoming permanent by default  

These risks are intensified by urgency and asymmetric power over affected communities.

## 4. Applying the six domains of AI capability in emergency and resilience contexts

The AI Capability Framework provides a stabilising structure for decision-making under pressure.

### 4.1 AI Awareness & Orientation

Emergency teams need a realistic understanding of AI limitations.

This includes:

- recognising uncertainty and error margins in models  
- understanding how data gaps affect outputs  
- avoiding assumptions that AI outputs are objective or complete  

This domain supports critical vigilance rather than speed alone.

---

### 4.2 Human–AI Co-Agency

Accountability in emergencies must remain human-led.

AI capability here involves:

- ensuring humans retain final decision authority  
- clearly assigning responsibility for AI-supported actions  
- resisting pressure to “let the system decide”  

Clear co-agency protects public trust and legal accountability.

---

### 4.3 Applied Practice & Innovation

AI can enhance preparedness and coordination when used carefully.

This domain supports:

- scenario exploration for planning and training  
- decision support during response with human oversight  
- post-incident analysis and learning  

Innovation must be bounded by safeguards appropriate to risk.

---

### 4.4 Ethics, Equity & Impact

Emergency responses can disproportionately affect vulnerable groups.

AI capability in this domain includes:

- recognising how AI may prioritise some communities over others  
- assessing equity impacts of automated triage or allocation  
- ensuring dignity and fairness in crisis decision-making  

Ethical emergency practice requires foresight, not just reaction.

---

### 4.5 Decision-Making & Governance

Emergency decisions are subject to scrutiny.

AI capability here involves:

- documenting how AI influenced decisions where feasible  
- aligning AI use with legal and civil contingencies frameworks  
- supporting accountability during review or inquiry  

Good governance remains essential, even under crisis conditions.

---

### 4.6 Reflection, Learning & Renewal

Resilience depends on learning.

Capability is strengthened when teams:

- review AI-supported decisions after incidents  
- learn from near-misses as well as failures  
- update plans, assumptions, and safeguards  

This domain supports preparedness rather than complacency.

---

## 5. Practical actions for emergency planning and resilience teams

The following actions strengthen AI capability in emergency contexts:

- **Define non-negotiable human decision points**  
  Be clear where AI cannot override professional judgement.

- **Treat forecasts as advisory**  
  Use them to inform, not determine, response.

- **Embed equity checks**  
  Consider who may be disproportionately affected.

- **Document key decisions**  
  Record rationale where AI input is significant.

- **Train under realistic conditions**  
  Include AI limitations in exercises and simulations.

- **Review after action**  
  Treat AI use as subject to continuous improvement.

---

## 6. Signals of mature AI capability in emergency and resilience work

Emergency systems with strong AI capability typically demonstrate:

- clear human accountability under pressure  
- cautious, proportionate use of AI  
- transparent communication with the public  
- equity-aware response planning  
- resilience under scrutiny and inquiry  
- learning-oriented post-incident review  

These signals reflect preparedness maturity, not technological intensity.

## 7. How this brief fits within the AI Capability Framework

This brief applies the AI Capability Framework (2026 Edition) to emergency planning and resilience contexts.

To deepen this work, teams may explore:

- the full AI Capability Framework (PDF)  
- Practice Guides focused on high-risk and public-impact contexts  
- the Application Handbook for organisational preparedness  
- facilitated scenario-based resilience workshops  

The Framework provides structure.  
Emergency and resilience teams provide judgement, care, and public protection.
