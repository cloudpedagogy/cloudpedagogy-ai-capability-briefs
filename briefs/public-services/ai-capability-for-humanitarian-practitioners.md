## 1. What this brief is for

This brief is for humanitarian practitioners working in contexts where artificial intelligence is increasingly used to support analysis, coordination, communication, and decision-making under conditions of urgency, uncertainty, and moral responsibility.

It is intended for practitioners involved in:

- emergency response and crisis coordination  
- needs assessment and situational analysis  
- logistics, resource allocation, and prioritisation  
- communication with affected communities and partners  
- monitoring, evaluation, and learning in humanitarian settings  

This is not a technology deployment guide or a data science manual.  
It is a capability briefing to support ethical judgement, accountability, and human-centred decision-making when AI is used in humanitarian action.

## 2. Why AI capability matters in humanitarian contexts

AI is increasingly used in humanitarian work to:

- analyse large, fragmented datasets rapidly  
- support needs assessment and early warning  
- optimise logistics and resource distribution  
- summarise reports, communications, and field updates  
- assist coordination across agencies and partners  

These uses can support speed and scale, but humanitarian contexts magnify risk:

- decisions can directly affect life, safety, and dignity  
- data may be incomplete, biased, or politically sensitive  
- affected populations often have little agency or recourse  
- errors can propagate quickly across systems and organisations  

AI capability ensures that AI supports humanitarian principles rather than undermining neutrality, equity, accountability, or trust.

---

## 3. Common risks and blind spots in humanitarian AI use

Across humanitarian contexts, recurring challenges appear:

- **Automation bias under pressure:** deferring to AI outputs when time is scarce  
- **Data bias and invisibility:** marginalised populations underrepresented in data  
- **False precision:** AI outputs presented with unjustified confidence  
- **Context loss:** local realities flattened into abstract indicators  
- **Accountability diffusion:** unclear responsibility for AI-influenced decisions  
- **Ethical drift:** emergency justification normalising problematic practices  

These risks arise from structural conditions, not lack of care or intent.

## 4. Applying the six domains of AI capability in humanitarian practice

The AI Capability Framework provides a stabilising structure for humanitarian decision-making under uncertainty.

### 4.1 AI Awareness & Orientation

Humanitarian practitioners need a grounded understanding of how AI behaves in crisis contexts.

This includes:

- recognising uncertainty and limitations in AI-supported analysis  
- understanding how data gaps reflect structural inequities  
- avoiding assumptions that AI outputs are objective or neutral  

This domain supports critical vigilance, not technical mastery.

---

### 4.2 Human–AI Co-Agency

Humanitarian accountability must remain human-owned.

AI capability here involves:

- ensuring humans retain authority over life-affecting decisions  
- resisting pressure to treat AI recommendations as determinate  
- clarifying who is responsible for acting on AI-informed insights  

Clear co-agency protects humanitarian responsibility and legitimacy.

---

### 4.3 Applied Practice & Innovation

AI can support humanitarian innovation when used cautiously.

This domain supports:

- exploratory scenario analysis to inform planning  
- rapid synthesis to support situational awareness  
- augmenting, not replacing, field expertise  

Innovation is appropriate when AI outputs are treated as inputs to judgement, not instructions.

---

### 4.4 Ethics, Equity & Impact

Humanitarian action is ethically charged by definition.

AI capability in this domain includes:

- scrutinising who benefits and who may be harmed  
- recognising how AI can amplify existing inequalities  
- prioritising dignity, consent, and protection of affected populations  

Ethical humanitarian AI use requires foresight and restraint, not just efficiency.

---

### 4.5 Decision-Making & Governance

Humanitarian organisations operate within complex accountability landscapes.

AI capability here involves:

- documenting how AI informed decisions and prioritisation  
- aligning AI use with humanitarian principles and mandates  
- ensuring decisions remain explainable to partners, donors, and communities  

Good governance supports trust under scrutiny.

---

### 4.6 Reflection, Learning & Renewal

Humanitarian contexts evolve rapidly.

Capability is strengthened when teams:

- review AI-influenced decisions after action  
- learn from unintended consequences as well as successes  
- update practices deliberately rather than normalising emergency shortcuts  

This domain supports resilience and ethical continuity.

---

## 5. Practical actions for humanitarian practitioners

The following actions strengthen AI capability in humanitarian settings:

- **Treat AI outputs as provisional**  
  Use them to inform discussion, not determine action.

- **Interrogate data sources**  
  Ask whose realities are represented — and whose are missing.

- **Preserve human judgement points**  
  Identify decisions that must remain explicitly human-led.

- **Document ethical reasoning**  
  Record why and how AI-informed decisions were made.

- **Engage local knowledge**  
  Balance AI insights with contextual and community perspectives.

- **Review after action**  
  Reflect on AI use once urgency subsides.

---

## 6. Signals of mature AI capability in humanitarian practice

Humanitarian teams with strong AI capability typically demonstrate:

- cautious, proportionate use of AI under pressure  
- clear human accountability for decisions  
- sensitivity to equity and power dynamics  
- transparency with partners and stakeholders  
- willingness to pause or override AI recommendations  
- learning-oriented reflection after crises  

These signals reflect ethical humanitarian maturity, not technological advancement.

## 7. How this brief fits within the AI Capability Framework

This brief applies the AI Capability Framework (2026 Edition) to humanitarian practice and crisis response.

To deepen this work, humanitarian teams may explore:

- the full AI Capability Framework (PDF)  
- Practice Guides focused on high-risk and public-impact contexts  
- the Application Handbook for governance and ethics pathways  
- facilitated scenario-based workshops for humanitarian teams  

The Framework provides structure.  
Humanitarian practitioners provide ethical judgement under extreme conditions.
