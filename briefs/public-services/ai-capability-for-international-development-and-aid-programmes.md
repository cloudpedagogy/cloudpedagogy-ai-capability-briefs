## 1. What this brief is for

This brief is for international development and aid programmes operating across global, regional, and local contexts where artificial intelligence increasingly supports planning, analysis, monitoring, evaluation, and coordination.

It is intended for programmes involved in:

- development planning and programme design  
- donor reporting and results frameworks  
- monitoring, evaluation, and learning (MEL)  
- partnership coordination and capacity building  
- cross-border policy, data, and implementation work  

This is not a guide to AI platforms for development analytics.  
It is a capability briefing to support ethical decision-making, equity, and accountability when AI is used in development and aid contexts.

## 2. Why AI capability matters in development and aid work

AI is increasingly used in development contexts to:

- analyse large, heterogeneous datasets  
- support needs assessment and prioritisation  
- model programme scenarios and outcomes  
- synthesise reports and donor documentation  
- coordinate information across partners  

Development and aid programmes operate under distinctive pressures:

- unequal power relations between donors and recipients  
- complex cultural, political, and historical contexts  
- high accountability to funders and communities  
- long-term consequences of short-term decisions  

AI capability ensures that AI supports development goals without reinforcing inequity, dependency, or extractive practices.

## 3. Common risks and blind spots in development-oriented AI use

Across development and aid contexts, recurring challenges appear:

- **Data asymmetry:** decisions shaped by data from some regions more than others.  
- **Context collapse:** local realities flattened into global indicators.  
- **Donor bias:** optimisation driven by reporting requirements rather than need.  
- **Capacity imbalance:** AI expertise concentrated in external actors.  
- **Accountability gaps:** unclear responsibility for AI-informed decisions.  
- **Sustainability risk:** short-term AI gains undermining long-term local capacity.  

These risks arise when AI use is not grounded in capability and partnership principles.

## 4. Applying the six domains of AI capability in development programmes

The AI Capability Framework provides a values-aligned structure for responsible development practice.

### 4.1 AI Awareness & Orientation

Development professionals need realistic understanding of AI-supported analysis.

This includes:

- recognising limitations of global datasets  
- understanding how historical inequities shape data availability  
- avoiding assumptions that AI outputs represent local truth  

This domain supports context-sensitive interpretation, not technical dominance.

---

### 4.2 Human–AI Co-Agency

Development accountability must remain human-led.

AI capability here involves:

- ensuring programme decisions remain owned by people, not models  
- clarifying who is responsible for acting on AI-informed insights  
- resisting deferral to AI outputs in politically or ethically sensitive decisions  

Clear co-agency protects agency and partnership integrity.

---

### 4.3 Applied Practice & Innovation

AI can support innovation in development when used cautiously.

This domain supports:

- exploratory analysis to inform programme design  
- synthesis across complex, multi-partner information  
- augmenting learning rather than enforcing uniform solutions  

Innovation is appropriate when AI supports adaptation, not standardisation.

---

### 4.4 Ethics, Equity & Impact

Development work is explicitly equity-focused.

AI capability in this domain includes:

- examining who benefits from AI-informed decisions  
- recognising how AI may reinforce global power imbalances  
- prioritising dignity, inclusion, and local agency  

Ethical development requires humility and restraint.

---

### 4.5 Decision-Making & Governance

Development programmes operate within layered governance environments.

AI capability here involves:

- documenting how AI influenced programme decisions  
- aligning AI use with donor requirements and ethical commitments  
- ensuring transparency for partners and communities  

Good governance sustains trust and legitimacy across stakeholders.

---

### 4.6 Reflection, Learning & Renewal

Development is iterative and long-term.

Capability is strengthened when programmes:

- reflect on outcomes of AI-informed interventions  
- learn from unintended consequences  
- update practices in partnership with local actors  

This domain supports sustainable, learning-oriented development.

---

## 5. Practical actions for development and aid programmes

The following actions strengthen AI capability in development contexts:

- **Interrogate data sources**  
  Understand whose realities are represented — and whose are missing.

- **Protect local agency**  
  Ensure AI supports, rather than overrides, local decision-making.

- **Align with development values**  
  Use AI in ways consistent with equity and sustainability goals.

- **Document decision rationale**  
  Record how AI inputs were weighed alongside contextual judgement.

- **Build shared understanding**  
  Discuss AI use openly with partners and stakeholders.

- **Review long-term impact**  
  Reflect beyond immediate outputs and indicators.

---

## 6. Signals of mature AI capability in development and aid work

Programmes with strong AI capability typically demonstrate:

- context-sensitive interpretation of AI outputs  
- clear human accountability for decisions  
- attention to equity and power dynamics  
- transparency with donors and communities  
- integration of learning into programme cycles  
- respect for local knowledge and agency  

These signals reflect development maturity, not technical sophistication.

## 7. How this brief fits within the AI Capability Framework

This brief applies the AI Capability Framework (2026 Edition) to international development and aid practice.

To deepen this work, programmes may explore:

- the full AI Capability Framework (PDF)  
- Practice Guides focused on public-impact and high-risk contexts  
- the Application Handbook for governance and ethics pathways  
- facilitated learning workshops with partners  

The Framework provides structure.  
Development and aid programmes provide equity-focused judgement and stewardship.
