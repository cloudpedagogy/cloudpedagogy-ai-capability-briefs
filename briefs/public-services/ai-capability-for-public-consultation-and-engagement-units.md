## 1. What this brief is for

This brief is for Public Consultation, Engagement, Participation, and Communications units responsible for designing and delivering processes through which organisations seek input, feedback, and dialogue with the public in contexts where artificial intelligence increasingly shapes analysis, synthesis, and communication.

It is intended for teams involved in:

- public consultation and engagement exercises  
- policy development and service redesign engagement  
- stakeholder and community participation processes  
- synthesis and reporting of public feedback  
- democratic and deliberative engagement initiatives  

This is not a technical guide to AI survey tools or analytics platforms.  
It is a capability briefing to support democratic legitimacy, ethical judgement, and defensible decision-making when AI becomes part of public engagement practice.

## 2. Why AI capability matters for public consultation and engagement

AI is increasingly used to:

- analyse large volumes of consultation responses  
- summarise qualitative feedback  
- generate engagement materials or draft reports  
- support sentiment analysis or thematic clustering  

Public consultation processes underpin trust in public decision-making. When AI shapes how voices are heard, represented, or prioritised, the stakes are high.

Without explicit AI capability, engagement processes risk:

- misrepresenting public views  
- amplifying dominant or already-heard voices  
- obscuring how decisions were informed  
- undermining confidence in consultation outcomes  

AI capability ensures that AI enhances participation without distorting democratic intent.

---

## 3. Common risks and blind spots in AI-supported engagement

Across public engagement contexts, recurring challenges appear:

- **Representation bias:** AI privileging dominant themes or language styles  
- **Opacity:** unclear how AI influenced analysis or reporting  
- **Over-summarisation:** loss of nuance, minority views, or dissent  
- **False consensus:** AI-generated synthesis presenting artificial agreement  
- **Participation erosion:** perception that consultation is automated or tokenistic  
- **Accountability gaps:** difficulty explaining how input shaped decisions  

These risks threaten the legitimacy of consultation if not actively managed.

## 4. Applying the six domains of AI capability in public engagement

The AI Capability Framework provides a principled structure for integrating AI into consultation without weakening democratic trust.

### 4.1 AI Awareness & Orientation

Engagement teams need a clear understanding of how AI analyses and generates language.

This includes:

- recognising how AI clusters, summarises, or weights responses  
- understanding limitations in capturing tone, context, and intent  
- avoiding assumptions that AI outputs reflect public consensus  

This domain supports critical interpretation, not automation.

---

### 4.2 Human–AI Co-Agency

Democratic responsibility must remain human-led.

AI capability here involves:

- ensuring humans retain ownership of interpretation and reporting  
- treating AI outputs as analytic aids, not conclusions  
- making clear who is accountable for engagement outcomes  

Clear co-agency protects the legitimacy of consultation.

---

### 4.3 Applied Practice & Innovation

AI can support scalable engagement when used carefully.

This domain supports:

- managing large or complex consultation datasets  
- exploring alternative ways of organising feedback  
- enhancing accessibility of engagement materials  

Innovation is beneficial when it strengthens inclusion rather than efficiency alone.

---

### 4.4 Ethics, Equity & Impact

Public engagement has ethical obligations to fairness and inclusion.

AI capability in this domain includes:

- recognising whose voices may be marginalised by AI analysis  
- ensuring minority or dissenting perspectives remain visible  
- avoiding extractive or performative consultation practices  

Ethical engagement requires attention to power and representation.

---

### 4.5 Decision-Making & Governance

Consultation processes are often scrutinised.

AI capability here involves:

- documenting how AI was used in engagement analysis  
- ensuring transparency in reporting and decision rationale  
- aligning AI use with participation standards and public law duties  

Good governance supports defensibility and public confidence.

---

### 4.6 Reflection, Learning & Renewal

Engagement practices evolve alongside public expectations.

Capability is strengthened when teams:

- review how AI use affected participation and trust  
- learn from feedback on consultation processes  
- update methods to reflect lessons learned  

This domain supports credible, adaptive engagement practice.

---

## 5. Practical actions for public consultation and engagement units

The following actions strengthen AI capability in engagement contexts:

- **Be transparent about AI use**  
  Explain clearly how AI supported analysis or reporting.

- **Protect minority voices**  
  Actively surface dissent and underrepresented perspectives.

- **Validate AI-generated summaries**  
  Cross-check outputs against original submissions.

- **Document interpretive judgement**  
  Record how human decisions shaped outcomes.

- **Align engagement and decision-making**  
  Make clear how consultation informed final decisions.

- **Review impact on trust**  
  Monitor public response to AI-supported engagement.

---

## 6. Signals of mature AI capability in public engagement

Engagement processes with strong AI capability typically demonstrate:

- transparent and explainable consultation outcomes  
- visible inclusion of diverse perspectives  
- confidence under scrutiny or challenge  
- alignment between engagement and decision-making  
- sustained public trust in consultation processes  
- learning-oriented improvement over time  

These signals reflect democratic maturity, not analytical sophistication.

## 7. How this brief fits within the AI Capability Framework

This brief applies the AI Capability Framework (2026 Edition) to public consultation and engagement contexts.

To deepen this work, teams may explore:

- the full AI Capability Framework (PDF)  
- Practice Guides focused on equity and public impact  
- the Application Handbook for organisational implementation  
- facilitated reviews of consultation design and practice  

The Framework provides structure.  
Public engagement units provide legitimacy, voice, and trust.
