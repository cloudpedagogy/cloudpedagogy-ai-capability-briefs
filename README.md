# AI Capability Briefs  
**Practical, role-specific guidance aligned to the CloudPedagogy AI Capability Framework (2026 Edition)**

---

## What this repository is

This repository contains a curated collection of **AI Capability Briefs** — short, focused, professionally written PDF resources designed to help people use artificial intelligence confidently, responsibly, and defensibly in real work.

Each brief is tailored to a specific role, function, or context (for example: Programme Directors, Research Teams, Public Servants, Communications and Engagement Teams) and applies the **CloudPedagogy AI Capability Framework (2026 Edition)** to the everyday decisions those roles face.

These briefs are not about tools.  
They are about **judgement, responsibility, ethics, and decision-making** when AI becomes part of professional practice.

## Supporting resources in this repository

In addition to AI Capability Briefs, this repository also includes a small number of **supporting facilitation resources** that help educators, teams, and institutions *use* the Framework and briefs in practice.

These supporting resources include:

- **Scenario-based teaching and discussion materials**, such as the *AI Capability in Practice* quiz and facilitator guide, designed for seminars, workshops, and professional development
- **Facilitation and briefing slide decks**, intended for use in meetings, training sessions, and structured conversations

These materials are not briefs themselves.  
They are **enablers** — designed to help people teach with, discuss, and operationalise AI capability across different contexts.

The briefs remain the primary, standalone decision-support resources in this repository.

## What an AI Capability Brief is (and is not)

### An AI Capability Brief **is**:
- a decision-support resource  
- a role-specific guide to responsible AI use  
- a standalone PDF you can read, share, print, or discuss  
- a way to build confidence and clarity without becoming an AI expert  

### An AI Capability Brief **is not**:
- a technical manual  
- a training course  
- a policy document  
- a list of AI tools  
- a compliance checklist  

Each brief helps answer questions such as:

- What is my responsibility when AI is used in this role?  
- Where should human judgement remain central?  
- What risks or blind spots should I watch for?  
- How can I explain or justify AI-supported decisions if challenged?  

---

## How these briefs can be used (practically)

People use AI Capability Briefs to:

- prepare for meetings, committees, and reviews  
- support decision-making under uncertainty  
- brief senior leaders or stakeholders  
- guide ethical and governance discussions  
- support onboarding or professional development  
- create a shared language for AI across teams  
- reduce anxiety about “getting AI wrong”  

Each brief is designed to be read in **approximately 10–15 minutes** and can be used on its own.

## How the briefs relate to the AI Capability Framework

All briefs are grounded in the **CloudPedagogy AI Capability Framework (2026 Edition)**.

The Framework defines six interdependent domains of mature AI capability:

- **AI Awareness & Orientation**  
- **Human–AI Co-Agency**  
- **Applied Practice & Innovation**  
- **Ethics, Equity & Impact**  
- **Decision-Making & Governance**  
- **Reflection, Learning & Renewal**  

Each brief:

- interprets these six domains for a specific role or context  
- translates abstract principles into practical judgement  
- avoids repeating Framework text verbatim  
- shows how capability looks in practice, not just in theory  

The Framework provides the structure.  
The briefs provide application.

## How the briefs are organised

Briefs are organised by **capability context**, not by tools or technologies.

- **Education** — teaching, curriculum, assessment, and academic development  
- **Research** — roles across the research lifecycle  
- **Governance** — leadership, assurance, regulation, and organisational capability  
- **Public services** — civil service, policy, humanitarian, and justice-oriented contexts  
- **Health** — non-clinical healthcare, education, and public health roles  
- **Creative** — cultural institutions and creative practice  
- **Individual practice** — consultants, freelancers, and professional services  
- **Information services** — library, information, and knowledge stewardship  
- **Cross-cutting** — contexts that apply across multiple sectors

## Suggested starting points

If you are not sure where to begin:

- start with the brief closest to your current role, or  
- read a cross-cutting brief alongside a role-specific one  

The goal is not mastery — it is **better judgement**.
